The series is produced by Lucasfilm Animation in collaboration with Robot Chicken creators Seth Green and Matthew Senreich , [1] [2] Although roughly two seasons of the show exist, they have never been released to the public. Since The Walt Disney Company 's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, the show has been on hiatus, to allow Lucasfilm Animation to focus on other projects. [3]  Production [ edit ]  The series was announced at Star Wars Celebration VI in summer 2012. [4] The series was intended to be set between the events of Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope . In March 2013, Lucasfilm postponed Detours , reconsidering whether releasing a comedy series prior to making the sequel trilogy "makes sense". [5] That September, Green said 39 episodes had been completed, with 62 additional scripts finished. [6]  Voice actors that were involved in the show included Dee Bradley Baker , Abraham Benrubi , Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks , Anthony Daniels as C-3PO , Felicia Day , Donald Faison , Nat Faxon , Seth Green as Obi-Wan Kenobi , Jennifer Hale , Zachary Levi , Joel McHale , Breckin Meyer , Dan Milano , Cree Summer , Catherine Taber as Princess Leia , Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian , "Weird Al" Yankovic , Grey DeLisle , and Seth MacFarlane as Palpatine .  Writers for the series included Dan Milano , Tom Root , Zeb Wells , Doug Goldstein , Breckin Meyer , Kevin Shinick , David A. Goodman , Michael Price , and Jane Espenson . Brendan Hay served as head writer. [4]  In October 2015, during a live stream, Felicia Day mentioned that the show was canceled. [7]  References [ edit ]     ^  Taylor, Chris (2014).

The Book of Kells    Codex Cenannensis Leabhar Cheanannais     Folio 32v shows Christ enthroned.     Also known as  Book of Columba    Language  Latin    Date  9th century    Provenance  Columban monasteries in Ireland, Scotland and England    Manuscript(s)  TCD MS 58    Genre  Gospel book    Length  340 folios    Sources  Vulgate , Vetus Latina    The Book of Kells ( Latin : Codex Cenannensis ; Irish : Leabhar Cheanannais ; Dublin, Trinity College Library, MS A. I. [58], sometimes known as the Book of Columba ) is an illuminated manuscript  Gospel book in Latin , containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various prefatory texts and tables. It was created in a Columban monastery in either Britain or Ireland and may have had contributions from various Columban institutions from both Britain and Ireland. It is believed to have been created c. 800 AD. The text of the Gospels is largely drawn from the Vulgate , although it also includes several passages drawn from the earlier versions of the Bible known as the Vetus Latina . It is a masterwork of Western calligraphy and represents the pinnacle of Insular illumination . It is also widely regarded as Ireland's finest national treasure .  The illustrations and ornamentation of the Book of Kells surpass that of other Insular Gospel books in extravagance and complexity. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art . Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, together with Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations.  The manuscript today comprises 340 folios and, since 1953, has been bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum , and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest extension of the anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular majuscule script of the text itself appears to be the work of at least three different scribes. The lettering is in iron gall ink , and the colours used were derived from a wide range of substances, many of which were imports from distant lands.  The manuscript takes its name from the Abbey of Kells , which was its home for centuries. Today, it is on permanent display at Trinity College Library, Dublin . The Library usually displays two of the current four volumes at a time, one showing a major illustration and the other showing typical text pages, and the entire manuscript can be viewed on the Library's Digital Collections Repository .

Compare this page with the corresponding page from the Book of Kells (see here ), especially the form of the Lib monogram.    The Book of Kells is one of the finest and most famous, and also one of the latest, of a group of manuscripts in what is known as the Insular style , produced from the late 6th through the early 9th centuries in monasteries in Ireland, Scotland and England and in continental monasteries with Hiberno-Scottish or Anglo-Saxon foundations. [1] These manuscripts include the Cathach of St. Columba , the Ambrosiana Orosius , fragmentary Gospel in the Durham Dean and Chapter Library (all from the early 7th century), and the Book of Durrow (from the second half of the 7th century). From the early 8th century come the Durham Gospels , the Echternach Gospels , the Lindisfarne Gospels (see illustration at right), and the Lichfield Gospels . Among others, the St. Gall Gospel Book belongs to the late 8th century and the Book of Armagh (dated to 807–809) to the early 9th century. [2]  Scholars place these manuscripts together based on similarities in artistic style, script, and textual traditions. The fully developed style of the ornamentation of the Book of Kells places it late in this series, either from the late 8th or early 9th century. The Book of Kells follows many of the iconographic and stylistic traditions found in these earlier manuscripts. For example, the form of the decorated letters found in the incipit pages for the Gospels is surprisingly consistent in Insular Gospels. Compare, for example, the incipit pages of the Gospel of Matthew  in the Lindisfarne Gospels and in the Book of Kells , both of which feature intricate decorative knot work patterns inside the outlines formed by the enlarged initial letters of the text. (For a more complete list of related manuscripts, see: List of Hiberno-Saxon illustrated manuscripts ). [3]  The Abbey of Kells in Kells, County Meath had been founded, or refounded, from Iona, the building taking from 807 until the consecration of the church in 814. [4] The manuscript's date and place of production have been the subject of considerable debate. Traditionally, the book was thought to have been created in the time of Columba , [5] possibly even as the work of his own hands. This tradition has long been discredited on paleographic and stylistic grounds: most evidence points to a composition date c. 800, [6] long after St. Columba's death in 597. The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with Viking raids on Iona , which began in 794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their holy relics into Ireland and Scotland. [7] There is another tradition, with some traction among Irish scholars, that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint's death. [8] Alternatively, as is thought possible for the Northumbrian Lindisfarne Gospels and also the St Cuthbert Gospel , both with Saint Cuthbert , it may have been produced to mark the "translation" or moving of Columba's remains into a shrine reliquary, which probably had taken place by the 750s. [9]  There are at least five competing theories about the manuscript's place of origin and time of completion. First, the book, or perhaps just the text, may have been created at Iona , and then taken to Kells. Second, the book may have been produced entirely at Iona. [10] Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at Kells. Fourth, it may have been produced in the north of England, perhaps at Lindisfarne , then brought to Iona and from there to Kells. Finally, it may have been the product of Dunkeld or another monastery in Pictish Scotland, though there is no actual evidence for this theory, especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland. [11] Although the question of the exact location of the book's production will probably never be answered conclusively, the first theory, that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells, is widely accepted. [1] Regardless of which theory is true, it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona.  Medieval period [ edit ]  Kells Abbey was plundered and pillaged by Vikings many times in the 10th century, and how the book survived is not known. [12] The earliest historical reference to the book, and indeed to the book's presence at Kells, can be found in a 1007 entry in the Annals of Ulster . This entry records that "the great Gospel of Columkille, (Columba) [13] the chief relic of the Western World, was wickedly stolen during the night from the western sacristy of the great stone church at Cenannas on account of its wrought shrine". [1] [14] The manuscript was recovered a few months later—minus its golden and bejewelled cover—"under a sod ". [15] It is generally assumed that the "great Gospel of Columkille" is the Book of Kells. [16] If this is correct, then the book was in Kells by 1007 and had been there long enough for thieves to learn of its presence. The force of ripping the manuscript free from its cover may account for the folios missing from the beginning and end of the Book of Kells. The description in the Annals of the book as "of Columkille"—that is, having belonged to, and perhaps being made by Columba—suggests that the book was believed at that time to have been made on Iona. [17]  Regardless, the book was certainly at Kells in the 12th century, when land charters pertaining to the Abbey of Kells were copied onto some of its blank pages. The practice of copying of charters into important books was widespread in the medieval period, and such inscriptions in the Book of Kells provide concrete evidence about its location at the time. [1]  The Abbey of Kells was dissolved due to the ecclesiastical reforms of the 12th century. The abbey church was converted to a parish church in which the Book of Kells remained.      Folio 27v contains the symbols of the Four Evangelists (Clockwise from top left): a man ( Matthew ), a lion ( Mark ), an eagle ( John ) and an ox ( Luke )    Book of Kildare [ edit ]  The 12th-century writer Gerald of Wales , in his Topographia Hibernica , described seeing a great Gospel Book in Kildare which many have since assumed was the Book of Kells. The description certainly matches Kells:   This book contains the harmony of the Four Evangelists according to Jerome , where for almost every page there are different designs, distinguished by varied colours. Here you may see the face of majesty, divinely drawn, here the mystic symbols of the Evangelists, each with wings, now six, now four, now two; here the eagle, there the calf, here the man and there the lion, and other forms almost infinite. Look at them superficially with the ordinary glance, and you would think it is an erasure, and not tracery. Fine craftsmanship is all about you, but you might not notice it. Look more keenly at it and you will penetrate to the very shrine of art. You will make out intricacies, so delicate and so subtle, so full of knots and links, with colours so fresh and vivid, that you might say that all this were the work of an angel, and not of a man.   Since Gerald claims to have seen this book in Kildare, he may have seen another, now lost, book equal in quality to the Book of Kells, or he may have misstated his location. [18] [19]  Modern period [ edit ]  The Book of Kells remained in Kells until 1654. In that year, Cromwell 's cavalry was quartered in the church at Kells, and the governor of the town sent the book to Dublin for safekeeping. Henry Jones , who later became bishop of Meath after the Restoration , presented the manuscript to Trinity College in Dublin in 1661, and it has remained there ever since, except for brief loans to other libraries and museums. It has been on display to the public in the Old Library at Trinity since the 19th century.  Over the years, the Book of Kells received several additions to its text. In the 16th century, one Gerald Plunkett of Dublin added a series of Roman numerals numbering the chapters of the Gospels according to the division created by 13th-century Archbishop of Canterbury  Stephen Langton . The prominent Anglican clergyman James Ussher counted and numbered its folios in 1621, shortly after James VI and I named him Bishop of Meath . [1]  The manuscript's rise to worldwide fame began in the 19th century. The association with St. Columba, who died the same year Augustine brought Christianity and literacy to Canterbury from Rome, was used to demonstrate Ireland's cultural primacy, seemingly providing "irrefutable precedence in the debate on the relative authority of the Irish and Roman churches". [20]  Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were invited to sign the book in 1849. [21] The book's artistry was influential on the Celtic Revival ; several Victorian picture books of medieval illuminations featured designs from the book which were in turn extensively copied and adapted, patterns appearing in metalwork, embroidery, furniture and pottery among other crafts. [22]  Over the centuries, the book has been rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some illustrations being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. [23] [24] Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened at a major decorated page, and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations. [25]  In 2000, the volume containing the Gospel of Mark was sent to Canberra , Australia, for an exhibition of illuminated manuscripts. This was only the fourth time the Book of Kells had been sent abroad for exhibition. Unfortunately, the volume suffered what has been called "minor pigment damage" while en route to Canberra. It is thought that the vibrations from the aeroplane's engines during the long flight may have caused the damage. [26]  Description [ edit ]  The Book of Kells contains the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of Gospel passages. [27] Today, it consists of 340 vellum leaves, or folios . The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets, called bifolios , which are folded in half to form two folios. The bifolios are nested inside of each other and sewn together to form gatherings called quires . On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolio but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire. The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires. There are between four and twelve folios (two to six bifolios) per quire; the folios are commonly, but not invariably, bound in groups of ten. Some folios are single sheets, as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages. The folios had lines drawn for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolios were folded. Prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages. [24] The vellum is of high quality, although the folios have an uneven thickness, with some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent.  The book's current dimensions are 330 by 250 mm. Originally, the folios were of no standard size, but they were cropped to the current size during a 19th-century rebinding. The text area is approximately 250 by 170 mm. Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text. [24] The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its great age, though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing. The book must have been the product of a major scriptorium over several years, yet was apparently never finished, the projected decoration of some pages appearing only in outline. It is believed that some 30 folios of the original manuscript have been lost over the centuries. [24] Ussher counted 344 folios in 1621, but several leaves had already been lost by then. The overall estimate is based on gaps in the text and the absence of certain key illustrations.  Contents [ edit ]  The extant book contains preliminary matter, the complete text of the Gospels of Matthew , Mark and Luke , and the Gospel of John through John 17:13. The remainder of John and an unknown amount of the preliminary matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen early in the 11th century. The remaining preliminary matter consists of two fragmentary lists of Hebrew names contained in the Gospels, Breves causae (Gospel summaries), Argumenta (short biographies of the Evangelists), and Eusebian  canon tables . It is probable that, like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh, part of the lost preliminary material included the letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus I beginning Novum opus , in which Jerome explains the purpose of his translation. It is also possible, though less likely, that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus, in which he explains the use of the canon tables. [28] Of all the insular Gospels, only the Lindisfarne manuscript contains this letter.      Folio 5r contains a page of the Eusebian Canons .    There are two fragments of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted at the end of the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John. [29]  The first list fragment is followed by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea . These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables in such a way as to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages. [28]      Folio 19 contains the beginning of the Breves causae of Luke.    The Breves causae and Argumenta belong to a pre-Vulgate tradition of manuscripts. The Breves causae are summaries of the Old Latin translations of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters. These chapter numbers, like the numbers for the canon tables, are not used on the text pages of the Gospels. It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used, even if the manuscript had been completed, because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations and would have been difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text. The Argumenta are collections of legends about the Evangelists. The Breves causae and Argumenta are arranged in a strange order: first come the Breves causae and Argumenta for Matthew, followed by the Breves and Argumenta for Mark, then, quite oddly, come the Argumenta of both Luke and John, followed by their Breves causae . This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow, although in the latter instance, the misplaced sections appear at the very end of the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary. [28] In other insular manuscripts, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels , the Book of Armagh , and the Echternach Gospels , each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it. [30] The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the Breves causae and Argumenta found in Durrow led scholar T. K. Abbott to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand.  Text and script [ edit ]  The Book of Kells contains the text of the four Gospels based on the Vulgate. It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, there does not seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.      Folio 309r contains text from the Gospel of John written in Insular majuscule by the scribe known as Hand B.    The manuscript is written primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s ). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Françoise Henry identified at least three scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. [31] Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 through the end of the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West. [31] Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page. [32]     Luke's genealogy of Jesus (extends over three pages)    Errors and deviations [ edit ]  There are a number of differences between the text and the accepted Gospels. In the genealogy of Jesus , which starts at Luke 3:23, Kells names an extra ancestor. [33]  Matthew 10:34b The canonised Bible reads "I came not to send peace, but a sword," but the manuscript reads gaudium ("joy") where it should read gladium ("sword") and so translates as "I came not [only] to send peace, but joy." [34]  The lavishly decorated opening page of the Gospel according to John in the Book of Kells had been deciphered by George Bain as: "In principio erat verbum verum" [35] [In the beginning was the True Word]. Therefore, the Incipit is a free translation into Latin of the Greek original λογος rather than a mere copy of the Roman version.  Decoration [ edit ]  The text is accompanied by many full-page miniatures , while smaller painted decorations appear throughout the text in unprecedented quantities. The decoration of the book is famous for combining intricate detail with bold and energetic compositions. The characteristics of the Insular manuscript initial, as described by Carl Nordenfalk, here reach their most extreme realisation: "the initials ... are conceived as elastic forms expanding and contracting with a pulsating rhythm. The kinetic energy of their contours escapes into freely drawn appendices, a spiral line which in turn generates new curvilinear motifs...". [36] The illustrations feature a broad range of colours, with purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and yellow being the colours most often used. Earlier manuscripts tend toward more narrow palettes: the Book of Durrow, for example, uses only four colours. As is usual with Insular work, there was no use of gold or silver leaf in the manuscript. The pigments for the illustrations, which included red and yellow ochre, green copper pigment (sometimes called verdigris ), indigo, and possibly lapis lazuli , [37] would have been imported from the Mediterranean region and, in the case of the lapis lazuli, from northeast Afghanistan. [38] Though the presence of lapis lazuli has long been considered evidence of the great cost required to create the manuscript, recent examination of the pigments has proven that lapis lazuli was not used. [37]  The lavish illumination programme is far greater than any other surviving Insular Gospel book. There are ten surviving full-page illuminations including two evangelist portraits , three pages with the four evangelist symbols , a carpet page , a miniature of the Virgin and Child , a miniature of Christ enthroned, and miniatures of the Arrest of Jesus and the Temptation of Christ . There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages for the first few words of each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages, there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text; in fact only two pages have no decoration. [39]      Folio 2r of the Book of Kells contains one of the Eusebian Canons .    The extant folios of the manuscript start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, make up the right-hand column. The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly. [40] The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise the doctrine of the four Gospels' unity of message.  The unity of the Gospels is further emphasised by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the unity of the Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon Tables ). [40] The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow. [41]      Folio 7v contains an image of the Virgin and Child . This is the oldest extant image of the Virgin Mary in a Western manuscript.    The remainder of the book is broken into sections with the divisions set off by miniatures and full pages of decorated text. Each of the Gospels is introduced by a consistent decorative programme. The preliminary matter is treated as one section and introduced by a lavish decorative spread. In addition to the preliminaries and the Gospels, the "second beginning" of the Gospel of Matthew is also given its own introductory decoration.  The preliminary matter is introduced by an iconic image of the Virgin and Child (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the Virgin in a Western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on the lid of St. Cuthbert's coffin of 698. The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon. [42]  The miniature of the Virgin and Child faces the first page of text and is an appropriate preface to the beginning of the Breves Causae of Matthew, which begins Nativitas Christi in Bethlem (the birth of Christ in Bethlehem). The beginning page ( folio 8r ) of the text of the Breves Causae is decorated and contained within an elaborate frame. The two-page spread of the miniature and the text makes a vivid introductory statement for the prefatory material. The opening line of each of the sections of the preliminary matter is enlarged and decorated (see above for the Breves causae of Luke), but no other section of the preliminaries is given the same level of treatment as the beginning of the Breves Causae of Matthew. [42]      Folio 291v contains a portrait of John the Evangelist .    The book was designed so that each of the Gospels would have an elaborate introductory decorative programme. Each Gospel was originally prefaced by a full page miniature containing the four evangelist symbols, followed by a blank page. Then came a portrait of the evangelist which faced the opening text of the Gospel which was given an elaborate decorative treatment. [43] The Gospel of Matthew retains both its Evangelist portrait ( folio 28v ) and its page of Evangelist symbols (folio 27r, see above). The Gospel of Mark is missing the Evangelist portrait but retains its Evangelist symbols page ( folio 129v ). The Gospel of Luke is missing both the portrait and the Evangelist symbols page. The Gospel of John, like the Gospel of Matthew, retains both its portrait (folio 291v, see at right) and its Evangelist symbols page ( folio 290v ). It can be assumed that the portraits for Mark and Luke and the symbols page for Luke at one time existed but have been lost. [44] The use of all four of the Evangelist symbols in front of each Gospel is striking and was intended to reinforce the message of the unity of the Gospels.  The decoration of the opening few words of each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect, turned into carpet pages. The decoration of these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis ("The book of the generation"). The lib of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border. [45]      Folio 29r contains the incipit to the Gospel of Matthew .    The border and the letters themselves are further decorated with elaborate spirals and knot work , many of them zoomorphic. The opening words of Mark, Initium evangelii ("The beginning of the Gospel"), Luke, Quoniam quidem multi , and John, In principio erat verbum ("In the beginning was the Word"), are all given similar treatments. Although the decoration of these pages was most extensive in the Book of Kells, these pages were decorated in all the other Insular Gospel Books. [46]  The Gospel of Matthew begins with a genealogy of Jesus . At Matthew 1:18 , the actual narrative of Christ's life starts . This "second beginning" to Matthew was given emphasis in many early Gospel Books, so much so that the two sections were often treated as separate works. The second beginning begins with the word Christ . The Greek letters chi and rho were normally used in mediaeval manuscripts to abbreviate the word Christ . In Insular Gospel Books, the initial Chi Rho monogram was enlarged and decorated. In the Book of Kells, this second beginning was given a decorative programme equal to those that preface the individual Gospels. [45] Folio 32 verso has a miniature of Christ enthroned. (It has been argued that this miniature is one of the lost evangelist portraits. However, the iconography is quite different from the extant portraits, and current scholarship accepts this identification and placement for this miniature.) Facing this miniature, on folio 33 recto , is the only carpet page in the Book of Kells, which is rather anomalous; the Lindisfarne Gospels has five extant carpet pages and the Book of Durrow has six. The blank verso of folio 33 faces the single most lavish miniature of the early mediaeval period, the Book of Kells Chi Rho monogram, which serves as incipit for the narrative of the life of Christ.      Folio 34r contains the Chi Rho monogram. [47]  Chi and rho are the first two letters of the word Christ in Greek .    In the Book of Kells, the Chi Rho monogram has grown to consume the entire page. The letter chi dominates the page with one arm swooping across the majority of the page. The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi. Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns. The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi. This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of a tradition that started with the Book of Durrow . [45]  The Book of Kells contains two other full-page miniatures, which illustrate episodes from the Passion story. The text of Matthew is illustrated with a full-page illumination of the Arrest of Christ ( folio 114r ). Jesus is shown beneath a stylised arcade while being held by two much smaller figures. [48] In the text of Luke, there is a full sized miniature of the Temptation of Christ ( folio 202v ). Christ is shown from the waist up on top of the Temple. To his right is a crowd of people, perhaps representing his disciples. To his left and below him is a black figure of Satan . Above him hover two angels. [49]  The verso of the folio containing the Arrest of Christ contains a full page of decorated text which begins " Tunc dicit illis ". Facing the miniature of the Temptation is another full page of decorated text (folio 203r "Iesus autem plenus"). In addition to this page, five other full pages also receive elaborate treatment. In Matthew, there is one other full-page treatment ( folio 124r , "Tunc crucifixerant Xpi cum eo duos latrones"). In the Gospel of Mark, there are also two pages of decorated text ( folio 183r , "Erat autem hora tercia", and folio 187v, "[Et Dominus] quidem [Iesus] postquam"). The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text (folio 188v, "Fuit in diebus Herodis ", and folio 285r , "Una autem sabbati valde"). Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them, it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed. There is no surviving full page of text in the Gospel of John other than the Incipit. However, in the other three Gospels, all the full pages of decorated text, except for folio 188c, which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative. However, since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative, it is likely that John contained full pages of decorated text that have been lost. [50]     Almost all of the folios of the Book of Kells contain small illuminations like this decorated initial.    The decoration of the book is not limited to the major pages. Scattered through the text are decorated initials and small figures of animals and humans often twisted and tied into complicated knots. Many significant texts, such as the Pater Noster have decorated initials. The page containing text of the Beatitudes in Matthew ( folio 40v ) has a large miniature along the left margin of the page in which the letter B which begins each line is linked into an ornate chain. The genealogy of Christ found in the Gospel of Luke ( folio 200r ) contains a similar miniature in which the word qui is repeatedly linked along the left margin. Many of the small animals scattered throughout the text serve to mark a "turn-in-the-path" (that is, a place where a line is finished in a space above or below the original line). Many other animals serve to fill spaces left at the end of lines. No two of these designs are the same. No earlier surviving manuscript has this massive amount of decoration.     The decorations of the Book of Kells can be stunningly complex, as seen in this small detail of the Chi Rho monogram page. ( Folio 34r )    The decorations are all high quality and often highly complex. In one decoration, which occupies a one-inch square piece of a page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses, although lenses of the required power are not known to have been available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these designs have also had an enduring popularity. Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos.  Purpose [ edit ]  The book had a sacramental rather than educational purpose. Such a large, lavish Gospel would have been left on the high altar of the church and removed only for the reading of the Gospel during Mass, with the reader probably reciting from memory more than reading the text. It is significant that the Chronicles of Ulster state the book was stolen from the sacristy , where the vessels and other accoutrements of the Mass were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design seems to take this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text. Lines were often completed in a blank space in the line above. The chapter headings that were necessary to make the canon tables usable were not inserted into the margins of the page. In general, nothing was done to disrupt the look of the page: aesthetics were given priority over utility. [41]  Reproductions [ edit ]     Faksimile-Verlag image of folio 32v "Christ Enthroned"    Some of the first faithful reproductions made of pages and elements of the Book of Kells were by the artist Helen Campbell D'Olier in the 1800s. She used vellum and reproduced the pigments used in the original manuscript. [51] Photographs of her drawings were included in Sullivan's study of the Book of Kells, first printed in 1913. [52]  In 1951, the Swiss publisher Urs Graf Verlag Bern produced the first facsimile [53] of the Book of Kells. The majority of the pages were reproduced in black-and-white photographs, but the edition also featured forty-eight colour reproductions, including all the full-page decorations. Under licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin, Thames and Hudson produced a second facsimile edition in 1974. This edition included all the full-page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative section of the ornamentation of the text pages, together with some enlarged details of the illustrations. The reproductions were all in full colour, with photography by John Kennedy, Green Studio, Dublin.  In 1979, Swiss publisher Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested permission to produce a full-colour facsimile of the book. Permission was initially denied, because Trinity College officials felt that the risk of damage to the book was too high. By 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new facsimile. [54] After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, on the site of the original monastery.      Folio 183r from the 1990 facsimile of the Book of Kells contains the text "Erat autem hora tertia" ("now it was the third hour").    Mario Kleff also reproduced folios from the Book of Kells and together with Faksimile-Verlag Publisher Urs Düggelin, curated an exhibition of the Book of Kells which included these facsimile pages. These facsimiles were created using the original techniques and were also presented in the Diocesan Museum of Trier. [55]  The ill-fated Celtworld heritage centre, which opened in Tramore , County Waterford in 1992, included a replica of the Book of Kells. It cost approximately £18,000 to produce. [56]  In 1994, Bernard Meehan, Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College Dublin, produced an introductory booklet on the Book of Kells, with 110 colour images of the manuscript. His 2012 book contained more than 80 pages from the manuscript reproduced full-size and in full colour. [16]  A digital copy of the manuscript was produced by Trinity College in 2006 and was made available for purchase through Trinity College on DVD-Rom. It included the ability to leaf through each page, two pages at a time or look at a single page in a magnified setting. There were also a number of commentary tracks about the specific pages as well as the history of the book. Users were given the option to search by specific illuminated categories including animals, capitols and angels. It retailed for approximately €30 but has since been discontinued. The Faksimile-Verlag images are now online at Trinity College's Digital Collections portal .  In film [ edit ]  The 2009 animated film The Secret of Kells tells a fictional story of the creation of the Book of Kells by an elderly monk Aidan and his young apprentice Brendan, who struggle to work on the manuscript in the face of destructive Viking raids. It was directed by Tomm Moore and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2009. [57] It was praised for sequences of animation drawing from the illuminated pages.

Since 1990, the opening riff to Megadeth's " Peace Sells " has been the main opening theme for The Week In Rock .  It first began covering political news in the 1992 American presidential elections , through its "Choose or Lose" campaign. [2] [3] Since then, MTV has run "Choose or Lose" for other presidential elections in the United States. For the 2008 election , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton appeared on an MTV special to discuss the Iraq war. [4]  Throughout the 2000s, MTV News began publishing digital editorial content via their website, Twitter feed, YouTube channel and Facebook page, offering information about MTV programming and music/pop-culture news aggregation. [5] In November 2015, MTV introduced a new direction for its news department and hired Dan Fierman , former editorial director of Grantland , as MTV's editorial director and announced it would produce longform journalism, think pieces and diversify its staff. However, in June 2017, MTV decided to restructure its news division with a greater focus on video, laying off much of their editorial staff. [6]  In December 2016, MTV News posted a video called "2017 New Years Resolutions for White Guys" as a New Year's special. The video features people telling white men what they think should do better in the then upcoming year of 2017 . The video gained huge backlash for being racist and bigoted. [7] The reupload of the video currently has 54,910 dislikes and 1,152 likes on YouTube. [8]  MTV News in the U.S. [ edit ]  Current and former correspondents [ edit ]  Main article: List of Current and former MTV News correspondents  MTV News International [ edit ]  When MTV launched in Europe it used a variation of MTV News US reports with localized European reporting. Upon regionalization of MTV channels in 1997, MTV begun to localize presenters and reporting depending on the MTV region. Its flagship programming in Europe consisted of a daily news update MTV News Update and a weekly highlights show called MTV News Weekend Edition, these ceased airing in the early 2000s. With the move of MTV towards more reality based programming MTV News bulletins became a short news bulletin on the hours between 16:00 to 22:00 Monday to Friday on some MTV channels.  As of July 2013, Viacom International Media Networks has launched a new news bulletin which utilises the existing MTV News UK broadcasts. These MTV News International bulletins air on the majority of MTV channels (with exception to MTV US, MTV Canada, MTV Italy, MTV Brazil, MTV Japan, MTV China and MTV Latin America) in the English language which are either dubbed or subtitled. During MTV News broadcasts viewers are directed to mtvnews.co.uk for further news updates. The news bulletins are presented by MTV UK presenters.  MTV Networks confirmed it would relaunch the MTV Brand and its content in mid-2016, MTV have yet to confirm whether this will impact on news broadcasts outside the US.

(December 2013)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )        Extended-play vinyl record    An extended play record, often referred to as an EP , is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single , but is usually unqualified as an album or LP . [1] [2] [3] EPs generally do not contain as many tracks as albums, and are considered "less expensive and time-consuming" for an artist to produce than an album. [3] An EP originally referred to specific types of vinyl records other than 78 rpm standard play (SP) and LP, [4] but it is now applied to mid-length CDs and downloads as well.  Ricardo Baca of The Denver Post said, "EPs—originally extended-play 'single' releases that are shorter than traditional albums—have long been popular with punk and indie bands." [5] In the United Kingdom , the Official Chart Company defines a boundary between EP and album classification at 25 minutes of maximum length or four tracks (not counting alternative versions of featured songs, if present). [1] [2]     Contents    1  Background  2  Definition  3  Double EPs  4  Jukebox EP  5  See also  6  References     Background [ edit ]  EPs were released in various sizes in different eras. The earliest multi-track records, issued around 1919 by Grey Gull Records , were vertically cut 78 rpm discs known as "2-in-1" records. These had finer than usual grooves, like Edison Disc Records . By 1949, when the 45 rpm single and 33​ 1 ⁄ 3 rpm LP were competing formats, seven-inch 45 rpm singles had a maximum playing time of only about four minutes per side.  Partly as an attempt to compete with the LP introduced in 1948 by rival Columbia , RCA Victor introduced "Extended Play" 45s during 1952 . Their narrower grooves, achieved by lowering the cutting levels and sound compression optionally, enabled them to hold up to 7.5 minutes per side—but still be played by a standard 45 rpm phonograph . These were usually 10-inch LPs (released until the mid-1950s) split onto two seven-inch EPs or 12-inch LPs split onto three seven-inch EPs, either sold separately or together in gatefold covers. This practice became much less common with the advent of triple-speed-available phonographs.  Some classical music albums released at the beginning of the LP era were also distributed as EP albums—notably, the seven operas that Arturo Toscanini conducted on radio between 1944 and 1954. These opera EPs, originally broadcast on the NBC Radio network and manufactured by RCA, which owned the NBC network then, were made available both in 45 rpm and 33​ 1 ⁄ 3 rpm. In the 1990s, they began appearing on compact discs. RCA also had success in the format with their top money earner, Elvis Presley , issuing 28 Elvis EPs between 1956 and 1967 , many of which topped the separate Billboard EP chart during its brief existence.  During the 1950s , RCA published several EP albums of Walt Disney movies, containing both the story and the songs. These usually featured the original casts of actors and actresses . Each album contained two seven-inch records, plus a fully illustrated booklet containing the text of the recording, so that children could follow along by reading. Some of the titles included Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940), and what was then a recent release, the movie version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea that was presented in 1954 . The recording and publishing of 20,000 was unusual: it did not employ the movie's cast, and years later, a 12 in 33⅓ rpm album, with a nearly identical script, but another different cast, was sold by Disneyland Records in conjunction with the re-release of the movie in 1963.  Because of the popularity of 7" and other formats, SP (78 rpm, 10") records became less popular and the production of SPs in Japan was suspended in 1963. [6] [7]  In the 1950s and 1960s, EPs were usually compilations of singles or album samplers and were typically played at 45 rpm on seven-inch (18 cm) discs, with two songs on each side. [8] [9] Other than those published by RCA, EPs were relatively uncommon in the United States and Canada , but they were widely sold in the United Kingdom , and in some other European countries, during the 1950s and 1960s. Record Retailer printed the first EP chart in 1960. The New Musical Express ( NME ) , Melody Maker , Disc and Music Echo and the Record Mirror continued to list EPs on their respective singles charts. The Beatles ' Twist and Shout outsold most singles for some weeks in 1963. When the BBC and Record Retailer commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to compile a chart it was restricted to singles and EPs disappeared from the listings.  In the Philippines , seven-inch EPs marketed as " mini-LPs " (but distinctly different from the mini-LPs of the 1980s) were introduced in 1970, with tracks selected from an album and packaging resembling the album they were taken from. [10] This mini-LP format also became popular in America in the early 1970s for promotional releases, and also for use in jukeboxes . [11]  Stevie Wonder included a bonus four-song EP with his double LP Songs in the Key of Life in 1976. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was less standardization and EPs were made on seven-inch (18 cm), 10-inch (25 cm) or 12-inch (30 cm) discs running either 33​ 1 ⁄ 3 or 45 rpm. Some novelty EPs used odd shapes and colors, and a few of them were picture discs .  Alice in Chains was the first band to ever have an EP reach number one on the Billboard album chart. Its EP, Jar of Flies , was released on January 25, 1994. In 2004, Linkin Park and Jay-Z 's collaboration EP, Collision Course , was the next to reach the number one spot after Alice in Chains. In 2010, the cast of the television series Glee became the first artist to have two EPs reach number one, with Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna on the week of May 8, 2010, and Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals on the week of June 26, 2010.  In 2010, Warner Bros. Records revived the format with their "Six-Pak" offering of six songs on a compact disc. [12]  Definition [ edit ]  The first EPs were seven-inch vinyl records with more tracks than a normal single (typically five to nine of them). Although they shared size and speed with singles, they were a recognizably different format than the seven-inch single. Although they could be named after a lead track, they were generally given a different title. [8] Examples include The Beatles ' The Beatles' Hits EP from 1963, and The Troggs ' Troggs Tops EP from 1966, both of which collected previously released tracks. [8] The playing time was generally between 10 and 15 minutes. [8] They also came in cardboard picture sleeves at a time when singles were usually issued in paper company sleeves. EPs tended to be album samplers or collections of singles. EPs of all original material began to appear in the 1950s. Examples are Elvis Presley's "Love Me Tender" from 1956 and "Just for You", "Peace in the Valley" and " Jailhouse Rock " from 1957, and The Kinks ' Kinksize Session from 1964.  Twelve-inch EPs were similar, but generally had between three and five tracks and a length of over 12 minutes. [8] Like seven-inch EPs, these were given titles. [8] EP releases were also issued in cassette and 10-inch vinyl formats. [8] With the advent of the compact disc (CD), more music was often included on "single" releases, with four or five tracks being common, and playing times of up to 25 minutes. [8] These extended-length singles became known as maxi singles and while commensurate in length to an EP were distinguished by being designed to feature a single song, with the remaining songs considered B-sides , whereas an EP was designed not to feature a single song, instead resembling a mini album.  EPs of original material regained popularity in the punk rock era, when they were commonly used for the release of new material, e.g. Buzzcocks ' Spiral Scratch EP. [8] These featured four-track seven-inch singles played at 33​ 1 ⁄ 3 rpm, the most common understanding of the term EP . [ citation needed ]  Beginning in the 1980s, many so-called "singles" have been sold in formats with more than two tracks. Because of this, the definition of an EP is not determined only by the number of tracks or the playing time; an EP is typically seen [ by whom? ] as four (or more) tracks of equal importance, as opposed to a four-track single with an obvious A-side and three B-sides.  In the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America , the organization that declares releases "gold" or "platinum" based on numbers of sales, defines an EP as containing three to five songs or under 30 minutes. [13] On the other hand, The Recording Academy 's rules for Grammy Awards state that any release with five or more different songs and a running time of over 15 minutes is considered an album, with no mention of EPs. [14]  In the United Kingdom, any record with more than four distinct tracks or with a playing time of more than 25 minutes is classified as an album for sales-chart purposes. If priced as a single, they will not qualify for the main album chart but can appear in the separate Budget Albums chart. [2]  An intermediate format between EPs and full-length LPs is the mini-LP , which was a common album format in the 1980s. These generally contained 20–30 minutes of music. [8]  In underground dance music, vinyl EPs have been a longstanding medium for releasing new material, e.g. Fourteenth Century Sky by The Dust Brothers .  Double EPs [ edit ]  A double extended play is the name typically given to vinyl records or compact discs released as a set of two discs, each of which would normally qualify as an EP. The name is thus analogous to double album . As vinyl records, the most common format for the double EP, they consist of a pair of 7" discs recorded at 45 or 33​ 1 ⁄ 3 rpm , or two 12" discs recorded at 45 rpm. The format is useful when an album's-worth of material is being pressed by a small plant geared for the production of singles rather than albums, and may have novelty value which can be turned to advantage for publicity purposes. Double EPs are rare, since the amount of material recordable on a double EP could usually be more economically and sensibly recorded on a single vinyl LP .  In the 1950s, Capitol Records had released a number of double EPs by its more popular artists, including Les Paul . The pair of double EPs (EBF 1-577, sides 1 to 8!) were described on the original covers as "parts... of a four part album". In 1960, Joe Meek 's I Hear a New World double EP was released in 1960 and has since become a collector's item. Probably the most well-known double EP is The Beatles ' Magical Mystery Tour , released as a double 7" EP in the United Kingdom eleven days after the long-playing version, which became the standard for compact disc reissue, was released in the United States . The Style Council album The Cost of Loving was originally issued as two 12" EPs.  It is becoming less uncommon to release two 12" 45s rather than a single 12" LP. Though there are 11 songs that total about 40 minutes, enough for one LP, the songs are spread across two 12" 45 rpm discs. Also, the vinyl pressing of Hail to the Thief by Radiohead uses this practice but is considered to be a full-length album. In 1982 Cabaret Voltaire released their studio album " 2x45 " on the UK-based label Rough Trade , featuring extended tracks over four sides of two 12" 45 rpm discs, with graphics by artist Neville Brody . The band subsequently released a further album in this format, 1985's " Drinking Gasoline ", on the Virgin Records label.  There are a limited number of double EPs which serve other purposes, [ which? ] however. An example of this is the Dunedin Double EP, which contains tracks by four different bands. Using a double EP in this instance allowed each band to have its tracks occupying a different side. In addition, the groove on the physical record could be wider and thus allow for a louder album. [ citation needed ]  Jukebox EP [ edit ]     Filben Maestro 78 rpm jukebox    In the 1960s and 1970s, record companies released EP versions of long-play (LP) albums for use in jukeboxes . These were commonly known as "compact 33s" or "little LPs". They played at 33​ 1 ⁄ 3 rpm, were pressed on seven-inch vinyl and frequently had as many as six songs. What made them EP-like was that some songs were omitted for time purposes, and the tracks deemed the most popular were left on. Unlike most EPs before them, and most seven-inch vinyl in general (pre-1970s), these were issued in stereo.

[6] The territory later to be known as Banat was conquered and annexed by the Kingdom of Hungary in 1030. Timișoara grew considerably during the reign of Charles I , who, upon his visit here in 1307, ordered the construction of a royal palace. Timișoara's importance also grew due to its strategic location, which facilitated control over the Banat plain. By the middle of the 14th century, Timișoara was at the forefront of Western Christendom 's battle against the Muslim  Ottoman Turks . French and Hungarian crusaders met at the city before engaging in the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396. Beginning in 1443, John Hunyadi used Timișoara as a military stronghold against the Turks, having built a powerful fortress. The city was repeatedly besieged by the Ottomans in 1462, 1476, 1491, and 1522.  16th–19th centuries [ edit ]  In 1552, a 16,000-strong Ottoman army led by Kara Ahmed Pasha  conquered the city and transformed it into a capital city in the region ( Temeşvar Eyalet ). The local military commander, István Losonczy, and other Christians were massacred on 27 July 1552 while escaping the city through the Azapilor Gate. [7]     Timișoara in 1656, a map by Nicolas Sanson    Timișoara remained under Ottoman rule for nearly 160 years, controlled directly by the Sultan and enjoying a special status, similar to other cities in the region such as Budapest and Belgrade . During this period, Timișoara was home to a large Islamic community and produced famous historical figures such as Osman Aga of Temesvar , until Prince Eugene of Savoy conquered it in 1716. Subsequently, the city came under Habsburg rule, and it remained so until the early 20th century, except for the Ottoman occupation between 1788–1789 during the Ottoman-Habsburg war . [8] The city was defortified starting in 1892 up until 1910, [9] and several major road arteries were built to connect the suburbs with the city centre, paving the way for further expansion of the city. [ citation needed ]  It was the first mainland European city and second in the world after New York to be lit by electric street lamps in 1884. [10] [11] It was also the second European and the first city in what is now Romania with horse-drawn trams in 1869. [12] It is said that Gustave Eiffel , the creator of the Eiffel Tower in Paris , drew the projects of one of Timișoara's footbridges over the Bega , the "Metal Bridge", however, it was actually planned by Róbert Tóth, the head of the Bridge Department, at the Reșița rail factory. [13]  20th century [ edit ]     Historical image of a streetcar in Timișoara in 1910    On 31 October 1918, local military and political elites establish the "Banat National Council", together with representatives of the region's main ethnic groups: Romanians , Germans , Serbs and Hungarians . On 1 November they proclaimed in Timișoara the short-lived Banat Republic . In the aftermath of World War I, the Banat region was divided between the Kingdom of Romania and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes , and Timișoara came under Romanian administration after Serbian occupation between 1918–1919. The city was ceded from Hungary to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon on 4 June 1920. In 1920, King Ferdinand I awarded Timișoara the status of a University Centre, and the interwar years saw continuous economic and cultural development. A number of anti-fascist and anti-revisionist demonstrations also took place during this time.  During World War II, Timișoara suffered damage from both Allied and Axis bombing raids, especially during the second half of 1944. On 23 August 1944, Romania, which until then was a member of the Axis, declared war on Nazi Germany and joined the Allies. Surprised, the local Wehrmacht garrison surrendered without a fight, [ citation needed ] and German and Hungarian troops attempted to take the city by force throughout September, without success.  After the war, the People's Republic of Romania was proclaimed, and Timișoara underwent Sovietization and later, systematisation . The city's population tripled between 1948 and 1992. In December 1989, Timișoara witnessed a series of mass street protests in what was to become the Romanian Revolution . [ citation needed ] On 20 December, three days after bloodshed began there, Timișoara was declared the first city free of Communism in Romania. [14]  Geography [ edit ]     Bega canal at night    Timișoara lies at an altitude of 90 metres (300 feet) on the southeast edge of the Banat plain, part of the Pannonian Plain near the divergence of the Timiș and Bega rivers. The waters of the two rivers form a swampy and frequently flooded land. Timișoara developed on one of few places where the swamps could be crossed. These constituted a natural protection around the fortress for a very long time, however, they also favoured a wet and insalubrious climate, as well as the proliferation of the plague and cholera, which kept the number of inhabitants at a relatively low number and significantly prevented the development of the city. With time, however, the rivers of the area were drained, dammed and diverted. Due to these hydrographical projects undertaken in the 18th century, the city no longer lies on the Timiș River , but on the Bega canal . This improvement of the land was made irreversible by building the Bega canal (started in 1728) and by the complete draining of the surrounding marshes. However, the land across the city lies above a water table at a depth of only 0.5 to 5 metres (1.6–16.4 feet), a factor which does not allow the construction of tall buildings. The rich black soil and relatively high water table make this a fertile agricultural region.  This is a relatively active seismic area, and earthquakes up to 6 on the Richter scale have been recorded.  Climate [ edit ]  Main article: Climate of Romania  Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is " Cfb " (Marine West Coast Climate/ Oceanic climate ). [15]  The climate which defines Timișoara city is the temperate - oceanic climate ( Köppen : Cfb) and can be regarded as humid continental (Dfb) when using an isotherm of 0 °C (32 °F). The city characterises the South-Eastern part of The Pannonian Basin .

The dominating temperate air masses during spring and summer are of oceanic origin and come with great precipitations. Frequently, even during winter period, the Atlantic humid air masses bring rainy and snowy weather, rarely cold weather.  From September until February, frequent continental polar air masses coming from the East invade the area. In spite of all that, the Banat climate is also influenced by the presence of cyclones and warm air masses which come from the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean. Their characteristic feature is that of complete snow thaw during the winter period and stifling heat during the summer period.  Freak measurable snowfalls have occurred as early as late October and as late as early April, but snow in those months is rare, and significant falls do not usually occur until late November. The median date for the first freeze is 22 October, while that of the last freeze is 15 April.

As defined by Eurostat , the Timișoara functional urban area has a population of 359,443 residents (as of 2015 [update] ). [2]  Of this population, 86.79% were ethnic Romanians , while 5.12% were Hungarians , 1.37% Germans , 1.3% Serbs , 0.69% Romani , 0.18% Ukrainians , 0.17% Slovaks , 0.11% Jews and 0.76% others. [19] 14.2% of the population are under 15 years of age, 4.0% are over 75.  Since 1990, Timișoara saw a slight population decline owing to migration and a drop in birthrates. Notably, the Hungarian and German communities experienced significant decline, with the latter being reduced by half between 1992 and 2002. [20] On the other hand, the Ukrainian community has grown, partly due to the presence of Ukrainian language educational facilities. In recent years, local investment by Italian companies has spurred the creation of an Italian community, [21] even leading to calls for an Italian Cultural Center. [22]  Historical populations [ edit ]  In 1910, according to the Austro-Hungarian census (based on the first language in daily use), Timișoara had 72,555 inhabitants. Of these, 31,644 (43.6%) used German language , 28,552 (39.4%) used Hungarian language , 7,566 (10.4%) used Romanian language , 3,482 (4.8%) used Serbian language , and 1,311 (1.8%) used other languages as everyday language. [23]  Economy [ edit ]  The economy of Timișoara has historic tradition in manufacturing , commerce , transport , education , communications and tourism .  Timișoara has been an important economic centre since the 18th century when the Habsburg administration was installed. Due to Austrian colonisation, ethnic and religious diversity and innovative laws, the economy began to develop. The technicians and craftsmen that settled in the city established guilds and helped develop the city's economy. In 1717, Timișoara became host to the first beer factory in Banat. [24]  During the Industrial Revolution , numerous modern innovations were introduced. It was the first city in Austria-Hungary with street lighting, and the first city in mainland Europe illuminated by electric light. The Bega river was also channelled during this time. It was the first navigable canal on current Romanian territory. This way, Timișoara had contact with Europe, and even with the rest of the world through the Black Sea, leading to the local development of commercialism . [25] [26] [27] In the 19th century, the railway system of the Hungarian Kingdom reached Timișoara.     City Business Centre       Regional Business Centre    Timișoara was the first city in the country with international routes economic boom as the amount of foreign investment, especially in high-tech sectors, has risen. In an article in late 2005, French magazine L'Expansion called Timișoara Romania's economic showcase, and referred to the increased number of foreign investments as a "second revolution". In 2016, Timișoara was awarded by Forbes as the most dynamic city and the best city for business in Romania. [28]  Apart from domestic local investment, there has been significant foreign investment from the European Union , particularly from Germany and Italy. Continental AG has produced tires since opening a plant in 1998. [29] In the years that followed, Continental also established an automotive software engineering division in Timișoara. All in all, as of 2015 [update]  Continental AG employed about 8000 people in Timișoara, and the company keeps expanding. [30] The Linde Group produces technical gases, and a part of the wiring moulds for BMW and Audi vehicles are produced by the company Dräxlmaier Group . Wiring for Volkswagen and other vehicles are produced at the German company Kromberg & Schubert.

Transport [ edit ]     Tramway and trolleybus routes    Timișoara has a complex system of regional transportation, providing road, air and rail connections to major cities in Romania and Europe.  Mass transit [ edit ]  Main article: Transport in Timișoara  Timișoara's public transport network consists of 9 tram lines, 9 trolleybus lines and 21 bus lines and it is operated by STPT (Societatea de Transport Public Timișoara), a company owned by the City Hall. The system covers all the important areas of the city and it also connects Timișoara with some of the communes of the metropolitan area.  In 2015, Timișoara became the first city in Romania to offer public transport by bike. The bicycle-sharing system has 25 stations and 300 bikes which can be used by locals and tourists for free. [36] Starting from 2016, STPT also offers vaporetto public transport on the Bega canal, resulting in Timișoara being the only city in Romania with 5 types of public transportation. [37]  Road [ edit ]  Timișoara is on two European routes ( E70 and E671 ) in the European road network . At a national level , Timișoara is located on four different national roads: DN6 , DN69, DN59 and DN59A. The Romanian Motorway A1 , under construction on some sections, will link the city with Bucharest and the eastern part of the country. The A1 is currently the only Romanian motorway that crosses a border, linking Timișoara with Hungarian motorway M43 . The Timișoara Coach Station ( Autogara ) is used by several private transport companies to provide coach connections from Timișoara to a large number of locations from all over the country. [38]  Air [ edit ]  The city is served by Romania's third busiest airport, Traian Vuia International Airport , located 10 km (6.2 mi) northeast away from the city centre. It used to be the hub of Romanian airline Carpatair , and it serves now as an operating base for low-cost airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air .  Railway [ edit ]  Timișoara is a major railway centre and is connected to all other major Romanian cities, as well as local destinations, through the national CFR network. Timișoara is directly linked by train service with Budapest , Belgrade and Vienna . The main railway station of the city is Timișoara North railway station . More than 130 trains use this station daily. The other three railway stations of the city are mainly ussed by commuter trains.  Cityscape [ edit ]      Metropolitan Cathedral    Currently, the tallest building is the Timișoara Orthodox Cathedral , at 91 metres (299 feet) and the tallest office building is the Fructus Tower , at 65 metres (213 feet). Other tall buildings, over 60 metres (200 feet), include: Asirom Financial Centre, Bosch Center, Continental Hotel and United Business Center 2. Another proposed building, the United Business Center 0, should be completed by the end of 2017 [ citation needed ] and will be part of the mixed use urban regeneration project: Openville. When completed, the building will have a height of 155 metres (509 feet) becoming the tallest building in Romania.  Government [ edit ]      Nicolae Robu , mayor of Timișoara       Timișoara City Hall       Administrative Palace, Timiș Prefecture headquarters    The first free local elections in post-communist Timișoara took place in 1992. The winner was Viorel Oancea , of the Civic Alliance Party (PAC), which later merged with the Liberal Party . He was the first officer who spoke to the crowd of revolutionaries gathered in Opera Square. The 1996 elections were won by Gheorghe Ciuhandu , of the Christian Democrats . He had four terms, also winning elections in 2000, 2004 and 2008. Meanwhile, Ciuhandu took over the Christian Democratic Party and ran for president of Romania in 2004. Timișoara's mayor, elected in 2012 and again in 2016, is Nicolae Robu . Deputy mayors are Dan Diaconu ( PNL ) and Farkas Imre ( UDMR ).  Like all other local councils in Romania, the Timișoara local council, the county council and the city's mayor are elected every four years by the population. Decisions are approved and discussed by the local council ( consiliu local ) made up of 27 elected councillors.

Border markings are comparatively inconspicuous, in common with many international borders in the European Union . As both states share a Common Travel Area and are part of the European Single Market , the border is essentially open , allowing free passage of people since 1923 and of goods since 1993. There are more than 200 public roads that cross the border. [3] Following the Brexit vote, the future of the border is uncertain and its status is one of the key points in the UK withdrawal negotiations .

[4] Prior to this, a separatist Irish parliament had been established in Dublin, which did not recognise the Government of Ireland Act, and was actively engaged in the Irish War of Independence . The Act was intended to deliver Home Rule in Ireland, with separate parliaments for Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland . Six of the thirty-two counties of Ireland were assigned to Northern Ireland, and the rest of Ireland comprising 26 counties to Southern Ireland.  The success of the Irish War of Independence , and the subsequent signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty , led to the creation of the Irish Free State – a dominion established for the whole island of Ireland on 6 December 1922. The border became an international frontier after the Parliament of Northern Ireland exercised its right to opt out of the Free State on 7 December 1922. The partition of 1921 created only a provisional boundary; a Boundary Commission met in 1924–25 to fix a permanent border between the two jurisdictions "in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions". [5] The manner in which the Boundary Commission clause was drafted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty was only explicit in its ambiguity. [6] Amongst politicians in Southern Ireland, there was remarkably little attention paid to the clause during the debates on the Treaty. The Republican activist Sean MacEntee was a "lone voice" in warning that the commission would involve an exercise "in transferring from the jurisdiction of the Government of Northern Ireland certain people and certain districts which that Government cannot govern; and by giving instead to Northern Ireland, certain other districts—unionist districts of Monaghan , Cavan and Donegal , so that not only under this Treaty are we going to partition Ireland, not only are we going to partition Ulster, but we are going to partition even the counties of Ulster." [2] [7]  The interim boundary was formalised in December 1925 by an inter-government agreement that was ratified by the three parliaments in London, Dublin and Belfast, without changes from the 1920 demarcation lines. [5] [8] The Boundary Commission's report was superseded by events and so it was not published until 1969. [5] The border agreement was then lodged with the League of Nations on 8 February 1926, making it a matter of international law .  The Irish Free State was renamed Ireland ( Irish : Éire ) by the 1937 constitution , and the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 formally declared that the state was a republic with the official description Republic of Ireland while not changing its name, which remains Ireland .  Customs and identity checks [ edit ]     The Irish border on the Lenamore Road, County Londonderry , Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland begins just in front of the speed signs and lies to the north of Northern Ireland at this location.    Main article: Common Travel Area  Customs controls were introduced on the frontier on 1 April 1923, shortly after the establishment of the Irish Free State. [9] These controls were maintained, with varying degrees of severity, until 1 January 1993, when systematic customs checks were abolished between European Community member states as part of the single market . [10] [11] [12] There are no longer any operational customs posts along either side of the border. Except during a brief period during World War II , it has never been necessary for Irish or British citizens to produce a passport to cross the border. However during the 1970s troubles , security forces regularly asked travellers for identification. [ citation needed ]  Military checkpoints [ edit ]  During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, there were British military checkpoints on main border crossings and UK security forces made the remaining crossings impassable. By about 2005, in phase with implementation of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement , remaining controls were definitively removed.  Dropped proposals to reinstate border controls [ edit ]  In October 2007, details began to emerge of a British Government plan that might end the Common Travel Area encompassing the United Kingdom and Ireland (and also the Isle of Man and Channel Islands) in 2009, possibly creating an anomalous position for Northern Ireland in the process. [13] In a statement to Dáil Éireann , the Irish Taoiseach  Bertie Ahern assured the House that "British authorities have no plans whatsoever to introduce any controls on the land border between North and South. I want to make that clear. All they are looking at is increased cross-border cooperation, targeting illegal immigrants." [13] This immediately raised concerns north of the border. Jim Allister , a former member of the Democratic Unionist Party and then a Member of the European Parliament , told The Times that it would be "intolerable and preposterous if citizens of the UK had to present a passport to enter another part of the UK". [13]  In July 2008, the UK and Irish governments announced their intent to resume controls over their common border and the Common Travel Area in general. Each proposed to introduce detailed passport control over travellers from the other state, where travel is by air or sea. [14] However, the land border will be 'lightly controlled'. [15] In a joint statement, Jacqui Smith , the British Home Secretary, and Dermot Ahern , the Irish Justice Minister, said:   It is crucial that our two countries work closely together to ensure our borders are stronger than ever. Both governments fully recognise the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland. Both governments reaffirm that they have no plans to introduce fixed controls on either side of the Irish land border. [14]   The Times reported that another consultation paper was to be published in the autumn of 2008 on whether people travelling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom should be subject to further checks.   One proposal is expected to suggest extending the electronic borders scheme, requiring travellers from Northern Ireland to provide their personal details in advance. This would mean residents of one part of the UK being treated differently from others when travelling within the country, something to which Unionists would object. [14]   However, in 2011, the governments renewed the 'de facto' agreement.  The 2011 inter-government agreement [ edit ]  2011 marked the first public agreement between the UK and Irish governments concerning the maintenance of the Common Travel Area. Officially entitled the "Joint Statement Regarding Co-Operation on Measures to Secure the External Common Travel Area Border", it was signed in Dublin on 20 December 2011 by the UK's immigration minister, Damian Green and Ireland's Minister for Justice, Alan Shatter . [16]  Traffic [ edit ]  The border is linked with 200 border crossing points (to 300 [17] ). Every month around 177,000 lorries, 208,000 vans, and 1,850,000 cars cross the border. Around 30,000 people cross the border daily to travel to work. [18]  Status post-Brexit [ edit ]     A Sinn Féin protest against a hard border. Post-Brexit border controls are a controversial issue.    The UK voted to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June 2016 . Their withdrawal would effectively make the Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland border an external EU border . [19] However, both the Irish and UK governments as well as EU representatives, have stated that they do not wish for a hard border in Ireland, taking into account the historical and social "sensitivities" that permeate the island. [20] In September 2016 the British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union , David Davis , stated that the UK government would not seek a return to a "hard border" between the UK and Republic of Ireland. [21]  Both governments will try to prioritize the protection of an open border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and the retention of the Common Travel Area. [22]  Brexit negotiations might also have this border considered as part of the Irish question: Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, has indicated he would look to the United Kingdom and Ireland for "solutions" to threats posed to Ireland's trading links, the common travel area and the Good Friday Agreement. [23] Denying UK media reports that Ireland expects the effective border to become the Irish Sea , Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that "the onus was on British officials to come up with an imaginative solution but [the Irish Government] would not support a proposal which would see a hard border return on Ireland". [24]  Some analysts [ which? ] consider that Brexit might lead to a hard border as the European Union needs to control its borders for customs reasons, while United Kingdom might have the choice between not controlling its border if VAT is not enforced or controlling the border in order to apply possible VAT on imported goods. [ citation needed ] The idea that Ireland could give UK information related to exported goods (such as Russia asked to EU) is not probable when United Kingdom is a third country. [25]  An additional question raised by Brexit is health since, before Brexit, some cooperation existed between both sides of the border for health issues, including mutual recognition of qualifications. The Northern Ireland branch of the British Medical Association warned that a hard border "could risk patient care". [26] The CEO of a body that organises cross-border cooperation in health matters suggested that the Norwegian model might be used. [26]  Joachim Pfeiffer ( CDU , Germany) believes border controls and customs checkpoints could be avoided, if United Kingdom were to perform some major concession such as to accept the four basic freedoms or to find a special solution for Northern Ireland, but that he did not consider this likely. [27]  Some Brexit negotiation papers suggest that deciding the arrangements for the Irish border is the responsibility of Britain [28] .  The Troubles [ edit ]  Main article: The Troubles  The Troubles in Northern Ireland required that attempts were made from the early 1970s until the late 1990s to enforce border controls. Many smaller cross-border roads were cratered or blockaded with the intention of making them impassable to regular traffic. Bridges were also destroyed to prevent access at unauthorised border crossings (known officially as "unapproved roads"). In particular, the border area in south County Armagh was dominated by British Army surveillance posts. Derry , the second-largest city in Northern Ireland, is close to the border with County Donegal . This meant that there was a heavy security presence around the city, often impeding traffic and general movement between Derry City and County Donegal. Despite these measures, the border was simply too long and had too many minor access roads to enable control of all cross-border movements. In any case, authorised crossing-points on the border remained open to civilian traffic in both directions at all times although vehicles and their occupants were subject to detailed searches while some crossing points were closed to vehicle traffic at night when customs posts were unstaffed.  Difficulty in patrolling parts of the border and large taxation/currency differences (particularly during the 1980s) led to widespread smuggling. However, greater European integration has led to roughly similar tax rates on most items and easing of restrictions on cross-border trade. Smuggling nowadays is mostly limited to fuel, livestock and a seasonal trade in illegal fireworks, which are strictly regulated in Ireland – in both countries there are restrictions on the types which can be used and a licence is required to possess or use fireworks, but in Ireland such licences are seldom issued to private individuals. [ citation needed ]  While it still exists de jure , the border presents no impediments to traffic in either direction. This has been mainly due to the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as a sharp reduction in cross-border activity by paramilitaries . EU integration has also played a part. Following the Northern Ireland peace process , military surveillance has been replaced by routine PSNI patrols.  Distinctive physical characteristics [ edit ]     Map of Northern Ireland and the border    The border is extremely irregular. Its irregularities were inherited from well-established county boundaries. [6] The 499 km (310 mi) [1] border is not explicitly described in statute but only implicitly inferred from the territorial definition of Northern Ireland as contained in the 1920 Government of Ireland Act. It states that "Northern Ireland shall consist of the parliamentary counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, and the parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, and Southern Ireland shall consist of so much of Ireland as is not comprised within the said parliamentary counties and boroughs." [29] The border has some distinctive features. Firstly, how irregular it is: the border is about four times the straight-line distance between Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. [6] Second, County Donegal is only connected to the rest of Ireland by a territorial isthmus 9 km (6 mi) wide, making it more convenient for some journeys from Donegal to other parts of Ireland to pass through Northern Ireland. Third, for only two relatively short sections of the border does it align with the provincial boundary of nine county Ulster between Fermanagh-Leitrim and Armagh-Louth. And lastly, as the border skirts Tyrone to the west and again to the south east, it encompasses Co. Fermanagh on three sides.  As a remnant of 17th century county limits, the border's physical profile indicates that it follows many water courses but only in the highlands of the Cavan-Fermanagh section could the border be said to accord with any significant physical impediments to movement. [6] There are around 200 road border crossings. Some roads cross the border twice or three times. The road N54 / A3 crosses the border four times within 10 km/6 miles. Before its closure in 1957, a section of one railway line between Clones, County Monaghan and Cavan crossed the border six times in eight miles, initially with customs checks at each crossing. [30] [31]  Maritime border [ edit ]  A 1988 treaty demarcates the boundary of the exclusive economic zones across the continental shelf from the south Irish Sea southwest to the Celtic Sea . [32]  Waters around Northern Ireland [ edit ]  The exact division of territorial waters between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland ('Southern Ireland' being coterminous with the territory of the modern-day Irish state) was a matter of some controversy from the outset. Section 1(2) of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 defined the respective territories of Northern Ireland and the then Southern Ireland as follows: [33]   ...Northern Ireland shall consist of the parliamentary counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, and the parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, and Southern Ireland shall consist of so much of Ireland as is not comprised within the said parliamentary counties and boroughs.   At the time of that Act, both Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland were to remain parts of the United Kingdom. Perhaps because of this, the Act did not explicitly address the position of territorial waters although Section 11(4) provided that neither Southern Ireland nor Northern Ireland would have any competence to make laws in respect of "Lighthouses, buoys, or beacons (except so far as they can consistently with any general Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom be constructed or maintained by a local harbour authority)".  When the territory that initially was Southern Ireland ultimately became a separate self-governing dominion outside the United Kingdom known as the Irish Free State , the status of the territorial waters naturally took on a significance it had not had before. Northern Ireland's Unionists were conscious of this matter from an early stage. They were keen to put it beyond doubt that the territorial waters around Northern Ireland would not belong to the Irish Free State. In this regard, James Craig , the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland put the following question in the British House of Commons on 27 November 1922 (the month before the establishment of the Irish Free State): [34]   Another important matter on which I should like a statement of the Government's intentions, is with regard to the territorial waters surrounding Ulster. Under the Act of 1920, the areas handed over to the Governments of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland respectively, were defined as the six Parliamentary counties of Northern Ireland and the twenty-six Parliamentary counties of Southern Ireland. I understand there is considerable doubt in the minds of lawyers and others as to whether these Parliamentary counties carry with them the ordinary territorial waters, extending three miles out from the shore. It has been asserted in some quarters that the Parliamentary counties only extend to low water mark. That has been exercising the minds of a good many people in Ulster, and I shall be glad if the Government in due course will inform the House what is their opinion on the subject and what steps they are taking to make it clear..... Am I to understand that the Law Officers have actually considered this question, and that they have given a decision in favour of the theory that the territorial waters go with the counties that were included in the six counties of Northern Ireland?   In response the Attorney General, Sir Douglas Hogg , said that "I have considered the question, and I have given an opinion that that is so [i.e. the territorial waters do go with the counties]".  However, this interpretation that the territorial waters went with the counties was later disputed by Irish Governments. A good summary of the Irish position was given by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch , during a Dáil debate on 29 February 1972:   ...[W]e claim that the territorial waters around the whole island of Ireland are ours and our claim to the territorial waters around Northern Ireland is based on the Government of Ireland Act of 1920. This Act is so referred to in the 1921 Treaty that the Northern Ireland which withdrew from the Irish Free State is identical with the Northern Ireland defined in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and defined as consisting of named counties and boroughs. It is, I think, common case between us that in English law the counties do not include adjacent territorial waters and, therefore, according to our claim these territorial waters were retained by the Irish Free State.   A particular dispute arose between the Government of the Irish Free State of the one part and the Northern Ireland and UK governments of the other part over territorial waters in Lough Foyle . [35] Lough Foyle lies between County Londonderry in Northern Ireland and County Donegal in the then Irish Free State. A court case in the Free State in 1923 relating to fishing rights in Lough Foyle held that the Free State's territorial waters ran right up to the shore of County Londonderry. [35] In 1927, illegal fishing on Lough Foyle had become so grave that Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Craig entered into correspondence with his Free State counterpart, W. T. Cosgrave . Craig indicated to Cosgrave that he proposed to introduce a Bill giving the Royal Ulster Constabulary powers to stop and search vessels on Lough Foyle. Cosgrave asserted all of Lough Foyle was Free State territory and that as such a Bill of that nature would be rejected by the Free State and its introduction would create "a very serious situation". [35] Cosgrave then raised the matter with the British government. Claims by The Honourable The Irish Society that its fishing rights in the Foyle were being violated by poachers from the Donegal side led to the 1952 creation of the Foyle Fisheries Commission under the joint authority of the Dublin and Belfast governments, which solved problems of jurisdiction without addressing the sovereignty question. The Commission was superseded by the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission established after the Good Friday Agreement under the remit of the North/South Ministerial Council . [36]  It appears [ original research? ] that the territorial waters generally are no longer disputed between the two states but the maritime boundary dispute between Ireland and the United Kingdom concerning Lough Foyle (and similarly Carlingford Lough ) may still not have been settled. As recently as 2005, when asked to list those areas of EU member states where border definition is in dispute, a British Government minister responding for the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs stated:   Border definition (ie the demarcation of borders between two internationally recognised sovereign states with an adjoining territorial or maritime border ) is politically disputed [between] Ireland [and the] UK (Lough Foyle, Carlingford Lough—quiescent) [37]   It appears [ original research? ] moves have been made on the Irish side to settle the issue. During Dáil debates on the Carlingford Fisheries Bill, a contributor to the debate stated that he welcomed "the Bill's aim of defining the area of jurisdiction over the Foyle." [38] However, it appears [ original research? ] that the Carlingford Fisheries Act 2007 ultimately remained silent on the point.  Identification [ edit ]     A bilingual traffic sign in County Louth , in Ireland, warning drivers travelling south across the border that metric speed limits are used in Ireland, whereas the United Kingdom uses imperial units.    It is estimated that there are 300 major and minor crossings along the 310-mile border. [39] The border is marked only by a small number of "Welcome To Northern Ireland" road signs on the UK side, placed there by the Northern Ireland Roads Service. [40] This can make identifying the border difficult for those unfamiliar with landmarks known to locals as the crossing point. At some crossings, there are signs welcoming visitors to the relevant local government authority district or, occasionally, reminding motorists of the need to ensure that their insurance is valid in the relevant jurisdiction.  Generally, signposts in Ireland which indicate distances to destinations are bilingual (in Irish and English) and give distances in kilometres while such signposts in Northern Ireland are only in English and give distances in miles. On larger roads, the approximate location of the border can be determined by signs reminding the driver of the change in units. In Northern Ireland, place-name and street/road-name signs are usually (but not always) English-only and street/road-name signs are more standardised and extensively used.  There are other immediate indicators when crossing the border: differences in the design of road signage and a change in road markings. The hard shoulder on non-motorway roads in Ireland is marked with a yellow, usually broken, line. The same marking in Northern Ireland is white and usually continuous. In Northern Ireland, roads use A (major) and B (minor) route prefixes, whereas Ireland's route prefixes are N (major, standing for national ) and R (minor, standing for regional ). Road signs in Ireland are mostly black/yellow and diamond shaped (similar to those in North America and Australasia ) whereas those in the UK are mainly black/white/red triangles or circles (the same as the rest of the European Union ). Signs also have subtle differences in colouring and fonts.  Since the adoption by Ireland of metric speed limits, warning signs have been placed on either side of the border to alert motorists to the change to or from miles or kilometres per hour . As the United Kingdom does not use the euro , advertised prices for service stations and shops will change currency on crossing, although many places along the border will accept cross-border currency informally (albeit usually at a rate favourable to the trader). Other typical signs of crossing a European border are also noticeable. These include subtle differences in the paving materials of road surfaces and pavements, sometimes with visible differences in colour between materials across the border, changes to street lighting when crossing the border, (though these also vary across intra-county borders), and changes in the colour of postboxes (green in Ireland, red in Northern Ireland).  By rail, there is no immediate sign of crossing the border, but the trackside mileage markers change from Irish-style [ clarification needed ] markers at the 59¾-mile post (from Dublin Connolly railway station ) to black-on-yellow markers, common to the United Kingdom, at the 60-mile (97 km) post, between Dundalk and Newry stations.  Mobile phone roaming charges [ edit ]  As in most places, radio signals from the cellular networks on both of the border sides often travel several kilometres (a few miles) across it. This is a source of annoyance to those resident in border areas as roaming charges are incurred with most service providers if the phone connects to the "wrong" network when making or even receiving a call. [41] [42]  Mobile phone roaming charges were abolished in the European Union from 15 June 2017 [43] Whether this arrangement will continue after Brexit is currently unclear.  Cultural references [ edit ]  Puckoon is a comic novel by Spike Milligan , first published in 1963. It is set in 1924 and details the troubles brought to the fictional Irish village of Puckoon by the Partition of Ireland when the new border passes directly through the village.

(January 2008)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components. If its operating quality decreases at all, the decrease is proportional to the severity of the failure, as compared to a naively designed system in which even a small failure can cause total breakdown. Fault tolerance is particularly sought after in high-availability or life-critical systems . The ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as graceful degradation . [1]  A fault-tolerant design enables a system to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system fails . [2] The term is most commonly used to describe computer systems designed to continue more or less fully operational with, perhaps, a reduction in throughput or an increase in response time in the event of some partial failure. That is, the system as a whole is not stopped due to problems either in the hardware or the software . An example in another field is a motor vehicle designed so it will continue to be drivable if one of the tires is punctured, or a structure that is able to retain its integrity in the presence of damage due to causes such as fatigue , corrosion , manufacturing flaws, or impact.  Within the scope of an individual system, fault tolerance can be achieved by anticipating exceptional conditions and building the system to cope with them, and, in general, aiming for self-stabilization so that the system converges towards an error-free state. However, if the consequences of a system failure are catastrophic, or the cost of making it sufficiently reliable is very high, a better solution may be to use some form of duplication. In any case, if the consequence of a system failure is so catastrophic, the system must be able to use reversion to fall back to a safe mode. This is similar to roll-back recovery but can be a human action if humans are present in the loop.

The top two images are each the result of viewing the composite image in a viewer that recognises transparency. The bottom two images are the result in a viewer with no support for transparency. Because the transparency mask (centre bottom) is discarded, only the overlay (centre top) remains; the image on the left has been designed to degrade gracefully, hence is still meaningful without its transparency information.    A highly fault-tolerant system might continue at the same level of performance even though one or more components have failed. For example, a building with a backup electrical generator will provide the same voltage to wall outlets even if the grid power fails.  A system that is designed to fail safe , or fail-secure, or fail gracefully , whether it functions at a reduced level or fails completely, does so in a way that protects people, property, or data from injury, damage, intrusion, or disclosure. In computers, a program might fail-safe by executing a graceful exit (as opposed to an uncontrolled crash) in order to prevent data corruption after experiencing an error. A similar distinction is made between "failing well" and " failing badly ".  Fail-deadly is the opposite strategy, which can be used in weapon systems that are designed to kill or injure targets even if part of the system is damaged or destroyed.  A system that is designed to experience graceful degradation , or to fail soft (used in computing, similar to "fail safe" [3] ) operates at a reduced level of performance after some component failures. For example, a building may operate lighting at reduced levels and elevators at reduced speeds if grid power fails, rather than either trapping people in the dark completely or continuing to operate at full power. In computing an example of graceful degradation is that if insufficient network bandwidth is available to stream an online video, a lower-resolution version might be streamed in place of the high-resolution version. Progressive enhancement is an example in computing, where web pages are available in a basic functional format for older, small-screen, or limited-capability web browsers, but in an enhanced version for browsers capable of handling additional technologies or that have a larger display available.  In fault-tolerant computer systems , programs that are considered robust are designed to continue operation despite an error, exception, or invalid input, instead of crashing completely. Software brittleness is the opposite of robustness. Resilient networks continue to transmit data despite the failure of some links or nodes; resilient buildings and infrastructure are likewise expected to prevent complete failure in situations like earthquakes, floods, or collisions.  A system with high failure transparency will alert users that a component failure has occurred, even if it continues to operate with full performance, so that failure can be repaired or imminent complete failure anticipated. Likewise, a fail-fast component is designed to report at the first point of failure, rather than allow downstream components to fail and generate reports then. This allows easier diagnosis of the underlying problem, and may prevent improper operation in a broken state.  Redundancy [ edit ]  Main article: Redundancy (engineering)  Redundancy is the provision of functional capabilities that would be unnecessary in a fault-free environment. [4] This can consist of backup components that automatically "kick in" if one component fails. For example, large cargo trucks can lose a tire without any major consequences. They have many tires, and no one tire is critical (with the exception of the front tires, which are used to steer, but generally carry less load, each and in total, than the other four to 16, so are less likely to fail). The idea of incorporating redundancy in order to improve the reliability of a system was pioneered by John von Neumann in the 1950s. [5]  Two kinds of redundancy are possible: [6] space redundancy and time redundancy. Space redundancy provides additional components, functions, or data items that are unnecessary for fault-free operation. Space redundancy is further classified into hardware, software and information redundancy, depending on the type of redundant resources added to the system. In time redundancy the computation or data transmission is repeated and the result is compared to a stored copy of the previous result. The current terminology for this kind of testing is referred to as 'In Service Fault Tolerance Testing or ISFTT for short.  Criteria [ edit ]  Providing fault-tolerant design for every component is normally not an option. Associated redundancy brings a number of penalties: increase in weight, size, power consumption, cost, as well as time to design, verify, and test. Therefore, a number of choices have to be examined to determine which components should be fault tolerant: [7]   How critical is the component? In a car, the radio is not critical, so this component has less need for fault tolerance.  How likely is the component to fail? Some components, like the drive shaft in a car, are not likely to fail, so no fault tolerance is needed.  How expensive is it to make the component fault tolerant? Requiring a redundant car engine, for example, would likely be too expensive both economically and in terms of weight and space, to be considered.   An example of a component that passes all the tests is a car's occupant restraint system. While we do not normally think of the primary occupant restraint system, it is gravity . If the vehicle rolls over or undergoes severe g-forces, then this primary method of occupant restraint may fail. Restraining the occupants during such an accident is absolutely critical to safety, so we pass the first test. Accidents causing occupant ejection were quite common before seat belts , so we pass the second test. The cost of a redundant restraint method like seat belts is quite low, both economically and in terms of weight and space, so we pass the third test. Therefore, adding seat belts to all vehicles is an excellent idea. Other "supplemental restraint systems", such as airbags , are more expensive and so pass that test by a smaller margin.  Another excellent and long-term example of this principle being put into practice is the braking system: whilst the actual brake mechanisms are critical, they are not particularly prone to sudden (rather than progressive) failure, and are in any case necessarily duplicated to allow even and balanced application of brake force to all wheels. It would also be prohibitively costly to further double-up the main components and they would add considerable weight. However, the similarly critical systems for actuating the brakes under driver control are inherently less robust, generally using a cable (can rust, stretch, jam, snap) or hydraulic fluid (can leak, boil and develop bubbles, absorb water and thus lose effectiveness). Thus in most modern cars the footbrake hydraulic brake circuit is diagonally divided to give two smaller points of failure, the loss of either only reducing brake power by 50% and not causing as much dangerous brakeforce imbalance as a straight front-back or left-right split, and should the hydraulic circuit fail completely (a relatively very rare occurrence), there is a failsafe in the form of the cable-actuated parking brake that operates the otherwise relatively weak rear brakes, but can still bring the vehicle to a safe halt in conjunction with transmission/engine braking so long as the demands on it are in line with normal traffic flow. The culmulatively unlikely combination of total footbrake failure with the need for harsh braking in an emergency will likely result in a collision, but still one at lower speed than would otherwise have been the case.  In comparison with the footpedal activated service brake, the parking brake itself is a less critical item, and unless it is being used as a one-time backup for the footbrake, will not cause immediate danger if it is found to be nonfunctional at the moment of application. Therefore, no redundancy is built into it per se (and it typically uses a cheaper, lighter, but less hardwearing cable actuation system), and it can suffice, if this happens on a hill, to use the footbrake to momentarily hold the vehicle still, before driving off to find a flat piece of road on which to stop. Alternatively, on shallow gradients, the transmission can be shifted into Park, Reverse or First gear, and the transmission lock / engine compression used to hold it stationary, as there is no need for them to include the sophistication to first bring it to a halt.  On motorcycles, a similar level of fail-safety is provided by simpler methods; firstly the front and rear brake systems being entirely separate, regardless of their method of activation (that can be cable, rod or hydraulic), allowing one to fail entirely whilst leaving the other unaffected. Secondly, the rear brake is relatively strong compared to its automotive cousin, even being a powerful disc on sports models, even though the usual intent is for the front system to provide the vast majority of braking force; as the overall vehicle weight is more central, the rear tyre is generally larger and grippier, and the rider can lean back to put more weight on it, therefore allowing more brake force to be applied before the wheel locks up. On cheaper, slower utility-class machines, even if the front wheel should use a hydraulic disc for extra brake force and easier packaging, the rear will usually be a primitive, somewhat inefficient, but exceptionally robust rod-actuated drum, thanks to the ease of connecting the footpedal to the wheel in this way and, more importantly, the near impossibility of catastrophic failure even if the rest of the machine, like a lot of low-priced bikes after their first few years of use, is on the point of collapse from neglected maintenance.  Requirements [ edit ]  The basic characteristics of fault tolerance require:   No single point of failure – If a system experiences a failure, it must continue to operate without interruption during the repair process.  Fault isolation to the failing component – When a failure occurs, the system must be able to isolate the failure to the offending component. This requires the addition of dedicated failure detection mechanisms that exist only for the purpose of fault isolation. Recovery from a fault condition requires classifying the fault or failing component. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) categorizes faults based on locality, cause, duration, and effect. [ where? ] [ clarification needed ]  Fault containment to prevent propagation of the failure – Some failure mechanisms can cause a system to fail by propagating the failure to the rest of the system. An example of this kind of failure is the "rogue transmitter" that can swamp legitimate communication in a system and cause overall system failure. Firewalls or other mechanisms that isolate a rogue transmitter or failing component to protect the system are required.  Availability of reversion modes [ clarification needed ]   In addition, fault-tolerant systems are characterized in terms of both planned service outages and unplanned service outages. These are usually measured at the application level and not just at a hardware level. The figure of merit is called availability and is expressed as a percentage. For example, a five nines system would statistically provide 99.999% availability.  Fault-tolerant systems are typically based on the concept of redundancy.  Replication [ edit ]  Spare components address the first fundamental characteristic of fault tolerance in three ways:   Replication : Providing multiple identical instances of the same system or subsystem, directing tasks or requests to all of them in parallel , and choosing the correct result on the basis of a quorum ;  Redundancy : Providing multiple identical instances of the same system and switching to one of the remaining instances in case of a failure ( failover );  Diversity: Providing multiple different implementations of the same specification, and using them like replicated systems to cope with errors in a specific implementation.   All implementations of RAID , redundant array of independent disks , except RAID 0, are examples of a fault-tolerant storage device that uses data redundancy .  A lockstep fault-tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel. At any time, all the replications of each element should be in the same state. The same inputs are provided to each replication , and the same outputs are expected. The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit. A machine with two replications of each element is termed dual modular redundant (DMR). The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods. A machine with three replications of each element is termed triple modular redundant (TMR). The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two-to-one vote is observed. In this case, the voting circuit can output the correct result, and discard the erroneous version. After this, the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two, and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode. This model can be applied to any larger number of replications.  Lockstep fault-tolerant machines are most easily made fully synchronous , with each gate of each replication making the same state transition on the same edge of the clock, and the clocks to the replications being exactly in phase. However, it is possible to build lockstep systems without this requirement.  Bringing the replications into synchrony requires making their internal stored states the same. They can be started from a fixed initial state, such as the reset state. Alternatively, the internal state of one replica can be copied to another replica.  One variant of DMR is pair-and-spare . Two replicated elements operate in lockstep as a pair, with a voting circuit that detects any mismatch between their operations and outputs a signal indicating that there is an error. Another pair operates exactly the same way. A final circuit selects the output of the pair that does not proclaim that it is in error. Pair-and-spare requires four replicas rather than the three of TMR, but has been used commercially.  Disadvantages [ edit ]  Fault-tolerant design's advantages are obvious, while many of its disadvantages are not:   Interference with fault detection in the same component. To continue the above passenger vehicle example, with either of the fault-tolerant systems it may not be obvious to the driver when a tire has been punctured. This is usually handled with a separate "automated fault-detection system". In the case of the tire, an air pressure monitor detects the loss of pressure and notifies the driver. The alternative is a "manual fault-detection system", such as manually inspecting all tires at each stop.  Interference with fault detection in another component. Another variation of this problem is when fault tolerance in one component prevents fault detection in a different component. For example, if component B performs some operation based on the output from component A, then fault tolerance in B can hide a problem with A. If component B is later changed (to a less fault-tolerant design) the system may fail suddenly, making it appear that the new component B is the problem. Only after the system has been carefully scrutinized will it become clear that the root problem is actually with component A.  Reduction of priority of fault correction. Even if the operator is aware of the fault, having a fault-tolerant system is likely to reduce the importance of repairing the fault. If the faults are not corrected, this will eventually lead to system failure, when the fault-tolerant component fails completely or when all redundant components have also failed.  Test difficulty. For certain critical fault-tolerant systems, such as a nuclear reactor , there is no easy way to verify that the backup components are functional. The most infamous example of this is Chernobyl , where operators tested the emergency backup cooling by disabling primary and secondary cooling. The backup failed, resulting in a core meltdown and massive release of radiation.  Cost. Both fault-tolerant components and redundant components tend to increase cost. This can be a purely economic cost or can include other measures, such as weight. Manned spaceships , for example, have so many redundant and fault-tolerant components that their weight is increased dramatically over unmanned systems, which don't require the same level of safety.  Inferior components. A fault-tolerant design may allow for the use of inferior components, which would have otherwise made the system inoperable. While this practice has the potential to mitigate the cost increase, use of multiple inferior components may lower the reliability of the system to a level equal to, or even worse than, a comparable non-fault-tolerant system.   Examples [ edit ]  Hardware fault tolerance sometimes requires that broken parts be taken out and replaced with new parts while the system is still operational (in computing known as hot swapping ). Such a system implemented with a single backup is known as single point tolerant , and represents the vast majority of fault-tolerant systems. In such systems the mean time between failures should be long enough for the operators to have time to fix the broken devices ( mean time to repair ) before the backup also fails. It helps if the time between failures is as long as possible, but this is not specifically required in a fault-tolerant system.  Fault tolerance is notably successful in computer applications. Tandem Computers built their entire business on such machines, which used single-point tolerance to create their NonStop systems with uptimes measured in years.  Fail-safe architectures may encompass also the computer software, for example by process replication .  Data formats may also be designed to degrade gracefully. HTML for example, is designed to be forward compatible , allowing new HTML entities to be ignored by Web browsers that do not understand them without causing the document to be unusable.  Related terms [ edit ]  There is a difference between fault tolerance and systems that rarely have problems. For instance, the Western Electric  crossbar systems had failure rates of two hours per forty years, and therefore were highly fault resistant . But when a fault did occur they still stopped operating completely, and therefore were not fault tolerant .

It was created by the Treaty of Rome of 1957. [1] Upon the formation of the European Union (EU) in 1993, the EEC was incorporated and renamed as the European Community ( EC ). In 2009 the EC's institutions were absorbed into the EU's wider framework and the community ceased to exist.  The Community's initial aim was to bring about economic integration, including a common market and customs union , among its six founding members : Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands and West Germany . It gained a common set of institutions along with the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) as one of the European Communities under the 1965 Merger Treaty (Treaty of Brussels). In 1993, a complete single market was achieved, known as the internal market , which allowed for the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within the EEC. In 1994, the internal market was formalised by the EEA agreement. This agreement also extended the internal market to include most of the member states of the European Free Trade Association , forming the European Economic Area covering 15 countries.  Upon the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, the EEC was renamed the European Community to reflect that it covered a wider range than economic policy. This was also when the three European Communities, including the EC, were collectively made to constitute the first of the three pillars of the European Union , which the treaty also founded. The EC existed in this form until it was abolished by the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon , which incorporated the EC's institutions into the EU's wider framework and provided that the EU would "replace and succeed the European Community".  The EEC was also known as the Common Market in the English-speaking countries and sometimes referred to as the European Community even before it was officially renamed as such in 1993.

This was an international community based on supranationalism and international law, designed to help the economy of Europe and prevent future war by integrating its members .  In the aim of creating a federal Europe two further communities were proposed: a European Defence Community and a European Political Community . While the treaty for the latter was being drawn up by the Common Assembly , the ECSC parliamentary chamber, the proposed defense community was rejected by the French Parliament . ECSC President Jean Monnet , a leading figure behind the communities, resigned from the High Authority in protest and began work on alternative communities, based on economic integration rather than political integration. [2] After the Messina Conference in 1955, Paul Henri Spaak was given the task to prepare a report on the idea of a customs union . The so-called Spaak Report of the Spaak Committee formed the cornerstone of the intergovernmental negotiations at Val Duchesse conference centre in 1956. [3] Together with the Ohlin Report the Spaak Report would provide the basis for the Treaty of Rome .  In 1956, Paul Henri Spaak led the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at the Val Duchesse conference centre, which prepared for the Treaty of Rome in 1957. The conference led to the signature, on 25 March 1957, of the Treaty of Rome establishing a European Economic Community.  Creation and early years [ edit ]  The resulting communities were the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM or sometimes EAEC). These were markedly less supranational than the previous communities, [ citation needed ] due to protests from some countries that their sovereignty was being infringed (however there would still be concerns with the behaviour of the Hallstein Commission ). The first formal meeting of the Hallstein Commission was held on 16 January 1958 at the Chateau de Val-Duchesse . The EEC (direct ancestor of the modern Community) was to create a customs union while Euratom would promote co-operation in the nuclear power sphere. The EEC rapidly became the most important of these and expanded its activities. One of the first important accomplishments of the EEC was the establishment (1962) of common price levels for agricultural products. In 1968, internal tariffs (tariffs on trade between member nations) were removed on certain products.  Another crisis was triggered in regard to proposals for the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy , which came into force in 1962. The transitional period whereby decisions were made by unanimity had come to an end, and majority-voting in the Council had taken effect. Then- French President  Charles de Gaulle 's opposition to supranationalism and fear of the other members challenging the CAP led to an "empty chair policy" whereby French representatives were withdrawn from the European institutions until the French veto was reinstated. Eventually, a compromise was reached with the Luxembourg compromise on 29 January 1966 whereby a gentlemen's agreement permitted members to use a veto on areas of national interest. [4] [5]  On 1 July 1967 when the Merger Treaty came into operation, combining the institutions of the ECSC and Euratom into that of the EEC, they already shared a Parliamentary Assembly and Courts . Collectively they were known as the European Communities . The Communities still had independent personalities although were increasingly integrated. Future treaties granted the community new powers beyond simple economic matters which had achieved a high level of integration. As it got closer to the goal of political integration and a peaceful and united Europe, what Mikhail Gorbachev described as a Common European Home .  Enlargement and elections [ edit ]      French President  Charles de Gaulle vetoed British membership, held back the development of Parliament's powers and was at the centre of the 'empty chair crisis' of 1965    The 1960s saw the first attempts at enlargement . In 1961, Denmark , Ireland , Norway and the United Kingdom applied to join the three Communities. However, President Charles de Gaulle saw British membership as a Trojan horse for U.S. influence and vetoed membership, and the applications of all four countries were suspended. [ citation needed ]  Greece became the first country to join the EC in 1961 as an associate member, however its membership was suspended in 1967 after the Colonels coup d' etat. [6]  A year later, in February 1962, Spain attempted to join the European Communities. However, because Spain, then ruled by Francisco Franco  was not a democracy , all members rejected the request in 1964.  The four countries resubmitted their applications on 11 May 1967 and with Georges Pompidou succeeding Charles de Gaulle as French president in 1969, the veto was lifted. Negotiations began in 1970 under the pro-European government of Edward Heath , who had to deal with disagreements relating to the Common Agricultural Policy and the UK's relationship with the Commonwealth of Nations . Nevertheless, two years later the accession treaties were signed so that Denmark, Ireland and the UK joined the Community effective 1 January 1973. The Norwegian people had finally rejected membership in a referendum on 25 September 1972 . [ citation needed ]  The Treaties of Rome had stated that the European Parliament must be directly elected, however this required the Council to agree on a common voting system first. The Council procrastinated on the issue and the Parliament remained appointed, [7] French President Charles de Gaulle was particularly active in blocking the development of the Parliament, with it only being granted Budgetary powers following his resignation. [ citation needed ]  Parliament pressured for agreement and on 20 September 1976 the Council agreed part of the necessary instruments for election, deferring details on electoral systems which remain varied to this day. [7] During the tenure of President Jenkins , in June 1979, the elections were held in all the then-members (see European Parliament election, 1979 ). [8] The new Parliament, galvanised by direct election and new powers, started working full-time and became more active than the previous assemblies. [7]  Shortly after its election, Parliament became the first Community institution to propose that the Community adopt the flag of Europe . [9] The European Council agreed to this and adopted the Symbols of Europe as those of the Community in 1984. [10] The European Council, or European summit, had developed since the 1960s as an informal meeting of the Council at the level of heads of state. It had originated from then- French President  Charles de Gaulle 's resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (e.g. the Commission) over the integration process. It was mentioned in the treaties for the first time in the Single European Act (see below). [11]     Enlargement, 1957 to 2013   Community enlargement   Since 1995     Towards Maastricht [ edit ]  Greece re-applied to join the community on 12 June 1975, following the restoration of democracy, and re-joined on 1 January 1981. [12] Following on from Greece, and after their own democratic restoration, Spain and Portugal applied to the communities in 1977 and joined together on 1 January 1986. [13] In 1987 Turkey formally applied to join the Community and began the longest application process for any country.  With the prospect of further enlargement, and a desire to increase areas of co-operation, the Single European Act was signed by the foreign ministers on the 17 and 28 February 1986 in Luxembourg and the Hague respectively. In a single document it dealt with reform of institutions, extension of powers, foreign policy cooperation and the single market. It came into force on 1 July 1987. [14] The act was followed by work on what would be the Maastricht Treaty , which was agreed on 10 December 1991, signed the following year and coming into force on 1 November 1993 establishing the European Union.  European Community [ edit ]  The EU absorbed the European Communities as one of its three pillars . The EEC's areas of activities were enlarged and were renamed the European Community , continuing to follow the supranational structure of the EEC. The EEC institutions became those of the EU, however the Court, Parliament and Commission had only limited input in the new pillars, as they worked on a more intergovernmental system than the European Communities. This was reflected in the names of the institutions, the Council was formally the "Council of the European Union " while the Commission was formally the "Commission of the European Communities ".  However, after the Treaty of Maastricht, Parliament gained a much bigger role. Maastricht brought in the codecision procedure , which gave it equal legislative power with the Council on Community matters. Hence, with the greater powers of the supranational institutions and the operation of Qualified Majority Voting in the Council, the Community pillar could be described as a far more federal method of decision making.  The Treaty of Amsterdam transferred responsibility for free movement of persons (e.g., visas , illegal immigration , asylum ) from the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) pillar to the European Community (JHA was renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCC) as a result). [15] Both Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice also extended codecision procedure to nearly all policy areas, giving Parliament equal power to the Council in the Community.  In 2002, the Treaty of Paris which established the ECSC expired, having reached its 50-year limit (as the first treaty, it was the only one with a limit). No attempt was made to renew its mandate; instead, the Treaty of Nice transferred certain of its elements to the Treaty of Rome and hence its work continued as part of the EC area of the European Community's remit.  After the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 the pillar structure ceased to exist. The European Community, together with its legal personality , was absorbed into the newly consolidated European Union which merged in the other two pillars (however Euratom remained distinct). This was originally proposed under the European Constitution but that treaty failed ratification in 2005.  Aims and achievements [ edit ]      This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .  (December 2007)     The main aim of the EEC, as stated in its preamble, was to "preserve peace and liberty and to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe". Calling for balanced economic growth, this was to be accomplished through: [16]   The establishment of a customs union with a common external tariff  Common policies for agriculture , transport and trade, including standardization (for example, the CE marking designates standards compliance)  Enlargement of the EEC to the rest of Europe   For the customs union, the treaty provided for a 10% reduction in custom duties and up to 20% of global import quotas. Progress on the customs union proceeded much faster than the twelve years planned. However, France faced some setbacks due to their war with Algeria . [17]  Members [ edit ]  Further information: Member state of the European Union and Enlargement of the European Union  The six states that founded the EEC and the other two Communities were known as the " inner six " (the "outer seven" were those countries who formed the European Free Trade Association ). The six were France, West Germany, Italy and the three Benelux countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The first enlargement was in 1973, with the accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Greece, Spain and Portugal joined in the 1980s. The former East Germany became part of the EEC upon German reunification in 1990. Following the creation of the EU in 1993, it has enlarged to include an additional sixteen countries by 2013.

The Council is also composed of one national minister who represents their national government. Each state also has a right to one European Commissioner each, although in the European Commission they are not supposed to represent their national interest but that of the Community. Prior to 2004, the larger members (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) have had two Commissioners. In the European Parliament , members are allocated a set number seats related to their population, however these ( since 1979 ) have been directly elected and they sit according to political allegiance, not national origin. Most other institutions, including the European Court of Justice , have some form of national division of its members.  Institutions [ edit ]  Further information: Institutions of the European Union  There were three political institutions which held the executive and legislative power of the EEC, plus one judicial institution and a fifth body created in 1975. These institutions (except for the auditors) were created in 1957 by the EEC but from 1967 onwards they applied to all three Communities. The Council represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest. [22] Essentially, the Council, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Council for approval and the Parliament for an opinion (in some cases it had a veto, depending upon the legislative procedure in use). The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply. [22] After the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, these institutions became those of the European Union, though limited in some areas due to the pillar structure. Despite this, Parliament in particular has gained more power over legislation and security of the Commission. The Court was the highest authority in the law, settling legal disputes in the Community, while the Auditors had no power but to investigate.  Background [ edit ]     The High Authority had more executive powers than the Commission which replaced it    The EEC inherited some of the Institutions of the ECSC in that the Common Assembly and Court of Justice of the ECSC had their authority extended to the EEC and Euratom in the same role. However the EEC, and Euratom, had different executive bodies to the ECSC. In place of the ECSC's Council of Ministers was the Council of the European Economic Community , and in place of the High Authority was the Commission of the European Communities .  There was greater difference between these than name: the French government of the day had grown suspicious of the supranational power of the High Authority and sought to curb its powers in favour of the intergovernmental style Council. Hence the Council had a greater executive role in the running of the EEC than was the situation in the ECSC. By virtue of the Merger Treaty in 1967, the executives of the ECSC and Euratom were merged with that of the EEC, creating a single institutional structure governing the three separate Communities. From here on, the term European Communities were used for the institutions (for example, from Commission of the European Economic Community to the Commission of the European Communities ). [23] [24] [25]  Council [ edit ]      President  Jacques Delors the last EEC Commission President.    The Council of the European Communities was a body holding legislative and executive powers and was thus the main decision making body of the Community. Its Presidency rotated between the member states every six months and it is related to the European Council , which was an informal gathering of national leaders (started in 1961) on the same basis as the Council. [26]  The Council was composed of one national minister from each member state. However the Council met in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture was being discussed, the Council would be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represented their governments and were accountable to their national political systems. Votes were taken either by majority (with votes allocated according to population) or unanimity. In these various forms they share some legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament. [26] Since the 1960s the Council also began to meet informally at the level of national leaders; these European summits followed the same presidency system and secretariat as the Council but was not a formal formation of it.  Commission [ edit ]  The Commission of the European Communities was the executive arm of the community, drafting Community law , dealing with the day to running of the Community and upholding the treaties . It was designed to be independent, representing the Community interest, but was composed of national representatives (two from each of the larger states, one from the smaller states). One of its members was the President , appointed by the Council, who chaired the body and represented it.  Parliament [ edit ]     The European Parliament held its first elections in 1979, slowly gaining more influence over Community decision making.    Under the Community, the European Parliament (formerly the European Parliamentary Assembly) had an advisory role to the Council and Commission. There were a number of Community legislative procedures , at first there was only the consultation procedure , which meant Parliament had to be consulted, although it was often ignored. The Single European Act gave Parliament more power, with the assent procedure giving it a right to veto proposals and the cooperation procedure giving it equal power with the Council if the Council was not unanimous.  In 1970 and 1975, the Budgetary treaties gave Parliament power over the Community budget . The Parliament's members, up-until 1980 were national MPs serving part-time in the Parliament. The Treaties of Rome had required elections to be held once the Council had decided on a voting system, but this did not happen and elections were delayed until 1979 (see European Parliament election, 1979 ). After that, Parliament was elected every five years. In the following 20 years, it gradually won co-decision powers with the Council over the adoption of legislation, the right to approve or reject the appointment of the Commission President and the Commission as a whole, and the right to approve or reject international agreements entered into by the Community.  Court [ edit ]  The Court of Justice of the European Communities was the highest court of on matters of Community law and was composed of one judge per state with a president elected from among them. Its role was to ensure that Community law was applied in the same way across all states and to settle legal disputes between institutions or states. It became a powerful institution as Community law overrides national law.  Auditors [ edit ]  The fifth institution is the European Court of Auditors , which despite its name had no judicial powers like the Court of Justice. Instead, it ensured that taxpayer funds from the Community budget have been correctly spent. The court provided an audit report for each financial year to the Council and Parliament and gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions. It is the only institution not mentioned in the original treaties, having been set up in 1975.

A negotiating period began on 29 March 2017 when the United Kingdom served the withdrawal notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union . The period for negotiation stated in Article 50 is two years from notification, unless an extension is agreed.  On 19 June 2017 British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis , arrived in Brussels to negotiate Brexit terms with European Chief Negotiator for the United Kingdom Exiting the European Union, Michel Barnier . [1]  Brexit negotiations might deal more or less with the withdrawal agreement, a temporary transitional period agreement and another agreement for the post transitional period.  Brexit negotiation might also need to address Free Trade Agreement treaties between European Union and its members (including UK) for one part and third countries for the other part, and the Tariff Rate Quota which might be split or renegotiated.

[4]  UK negotiation [ edit ]       David Davis , Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union .  Sir Tim Barrow , UK Permanent Representative to the EU      Theresa May , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom       The Department for Exiting the European Union is responsible for overseeing the negotiations to leave the EU and for establishing the future relationship between the UK and EU.  The proposed principles were set out in the Article 50 notification:       Constructive discussions  Citizens first  Comprehensive agreement  Minimise disruption      Ireland/Northern Ireland position  Technical talks on detailed policy  Work together on European values [5]       The Prime Minister's formal letter of notification was delivered in Brussels on 29 March 2017. [6] It included withdrawal from the European Atomic Energy Community . The letter recognized that consequences for the UK of leaving the EU included loss of influence over the rules that affect the European economy, and UK companies trading within the EU aligning with rules agreed by institutions of which the UK would no longer be part. It proposed agreeing to seven principles for the conduct of the withdrawal negotiation. These are for:   i. engaging with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation.  ii. aiming to strike an early agreement about the rights of the many EU citizens living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union.  iii. working towards securing a comprehensive agreement, taking in both economic and security cooperation, and agreeing the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.  iv. working together to minimise disruption and giving as much certainty as possible, letting people and businesses in the UK and the EU benefit from implementation periods to adjust in an orderly way to new arrangements.  v. in particular, paying attention to the UK’s unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  vi. beginning technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, including a Free Trade Agreement covering sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries.  vii. continuing to work together to advance and protect our shared liberal, democratic values of Europe, to ensure that Europe remains able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.   Role of the countries of the United Kingdom [ edit ]  Further information: Countries of the United Kingdom  The constitutional lawyer and retired German Supreme Court judge Udo Di Fabio has stated that separate negotiations of the EU institutions with Scotland or Northern Ireland would constitute a violation of the Lisbon Treaty, according to which the integrity of a member country is explicitly put under protection. [7]  UK general election [ edit ]  The start of negotiations was delayed until after the United Kingdom general election , which took place on 8 June 2017. [8]  Antonio Tajani , speaking on 20 April said that the early election should bring stability to the UK, which would have been good for negotiations. [9] In the event, the election led to a hung parliament which is expected to increase instability.  EU27 negotiation [ edit ]  See also: European Union negotiating directives for Brexit       Michel Barnier , European Commission chief negotiator  Jean-Claude Juncker , President of the European Commission  Donald Tusk , President of the European Council      Guy Verhofstadt , lead negotiator for the European Parliament  Antonio Tajani , President of the European Parliament       Following the United Kingdom's notification under Article 50, draft guidelines for the negotiations were sent to EU delegations of the 27 other member states (the EU27). The draft, prepared by the President of the European Council , states that the guidelines define the framework for negotiations under Article 50 and set out the overall positions and principles that the Union will pursue throughout the negotiation. It states that in the negotiations the Union's overall objective will be to preserve its interests, those of its Member States, its citizens and its businesses, and that, in the best interest of both sides, the Union will be constructive throughout and strive to find an agreement. The draft sets out two Core Principles:   "1. The European Council will continue to base itself on the principles set out in the statement of Heads of State or Government and of the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission on 29 June 2016. It reiterates its wish to have the United Kingdom as a close partner in the future. It further reiterates that any agreement with the United Kingdom will have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations, and ensure a level-playing field. Preserving the integrity of the European Single Market excludes participation based on a sector-by-sector approach. A non-member of the Union, that does not live up to the same obligations as a member, cannot have the same rights and enjoy the same benefits as a member. In this context, the European Council welcomes the recognition by the British Government that the four freedoms of the Single Market are indivisible and that there can be no "cherry picking". "    "2. Negotiations under Article 50 TEU ( Treaty on European Union ) will be conducted as a single package. In accordance with the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, individual items cannot be settled separately. The Union will approach the negotiations with unified positions, and will engage with the United Kingdom exclusively through the channels set out in these guidelines and in the negotiating directives. So as not to undercut the position of the Union, there will be no separate negotiations between individual Member States and the United Kingdom on matters pertaining to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union." [10]   According to the European Parliament, the withdrawal agreement and any possible transitional arrangement(s) should enter into force "well before the elections to the European Parliament of May 2019", and the negotiations should focus on: [11]   The legal status of European Union citizens living or having lived in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens living or having lived in other Member States, as well as other provisions concerning their rights;  The settlement of financial obligations between the United Kingdom and the European Union;  The European Union's external border;  The clarification of the status of the United Kingdom's international commitments taken as a Member of the European Union, given that the European Union of 27 Member States will be the legal successor of the European Union of 28 Member States;  Legal certainty for legal entities, including companies;  The designation of the Court of Justice of the European Union as the competent authority for the interpretation and enforcement of the withdrawal agreement.   On 18 April 2017, a spokesman for Donald Tusk said "We expect to have the Brexit guidelines adopted by the European Council on 29 April and, following that, the Brexit negotiating directives ready on 22 May". [12] On 29 April the EU27 unanimously endorsed the draft guidelines with no debate. [13]  In a speech to a plenary session of the European Committee of the Regions in Brussels on 22 March 2017, Barnier, as EU Chief Negotiator for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations, said that the EU wanted to succeed by reaching a deal with the British, not against them. [14]  On 22 May the European Commission Council, following the approval of negotiating directives which had been adopted by strong qualified majority (72% of the 27 Member States, i.e. 20 Member States representing 65% of the population of the EU27), authorised the opening of Article 50 discussions with the Commission appointed as the negotiator. It further confirmed that all agendas, EU position papers, Non-papers and EU text proposals will be released to the public and published on line. [15]  Intergovernmental organization [ edit ]  Intergovernmental organizations also involved in Brexit uncertainty considerations include the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). IATA expects an agreement to avoid disruption. [16]  Phases [ edit ]  EU27 guidelines include:   Agreement on the so-called " divorce bill ";  Agreement on rights of EU citizens living in the UK;  Agreement on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic   within the withdrawal phase. [13]  The second phase, covering the post-Brexit relationship between the EU27 and the UK, will begin "as soon as the European Council decides that sufficient progress has been made in the first phase towards reaching a satisfactory agreement on the arrangements for an orderly withdrawal". [17] The earliest opportunity for this decision was 19 October 2017, at a summit of EU leaders. [18] although at that meeting it was agreed to start negotiations during the December meeting. [19]  Negotiation policy [ edit ]    "We recognise how important it is to provide business, the public sector and the public with as much certainty as possible. So ahead of, and throughout the negotiations, we will provide certainty wherever we can. We will provide as much information as we can without undermining the national interest."   Government white paper The United Kingdom’s exit from and new partnership with the European Union , February 2017, p.9 [7]   Some effects of the UK withdrawal could emerge before the UK and the EU27 conclude the Article 50 negotiation, as a result of policies existing when the negotiation begins, or some change of policy later. At the outset policy provisions binding on the EU include principles, aspirations and objectives set out in the TEU ( Treaty on European Union ) Preamble [20] and Articles, [21] of which   Article 3 mentions the promotion of "scientific and technological advance" in a context governed by "The Union's aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples", the Union's internal market , "work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive social market economy , aiming at full employment and social progress", and the requirement that "The Union shall pursue its objectives by appropriate means commensurate with the competences which are conferred upon it in the Treaties",   and   Article 4 mentions "competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States".   Policies mentioned in the Preamble include:  – Achieve the strengthening and convergence of Member States' economies and establish an economic and monetary union including a single and stable currency,  – Promote economic and social progress for their peoples, taking into account the principle of sustainable development and within the context of the accomplishment of the internal market and of reinforced cohesion and environmental protection, and implement policies ensuring that advances in economic integration are accompanied by parallel progress in other fields,  – Establish a citizenship common to nationals of their countries,  – Implement a common foreign and security policy including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, thereby reinforcing the European identity and its independence in order to promote peace, security and progress in Europe and in the world,  – Facilitate the free movement of persons , while ensuring the safety and security of their peoples, by establishing an area of freedom, security and justice.  – Continue the process of creating an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.  UK policy was stated in a white paper published in February 2017: The United Kingdom’s exit from and new partnership with the European Union . [22] In the white paper, UK negotiating policy was set out as twelve guiding principles:   1. Providing certainty and clarity, including a "Great Repeal Bill" to remove the European Communities Act 1972 from the statute book and convert existing EU law into domestic law.  2. Taking control of the UK statute book and ending the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the UK.  3. Strengthening the Union of all parts of the Kingdom, and remaining fully committed to the Belfast Agreement and its successors.  4. Working to deliver a practical solution that allows for the maintenance of the Common Travel Area whilst protecting the integrity of the UK immigration system, and which protects the strong ties with Ireland.  5. Controlling the number of EU nationals coming to the UK.  6. Securing the status of EU citizens who are already living in the UK, and that of UK nationals in other Member States.  7. Protecting and enhancing existing workers’ rights.  8. Forging a new partnership with the EU, including a wide reaching free trade agreement, and seeking a mutually beneficial new customs agreement with the EU.  9. Forging free trade relationships across the world.  10. Remaining at the vanguard of science and innovation and seeking continued close collaboration with the UK's European partners.  11. Continuing to work with the EU to preserve European security, to fight terrorism, and to uphold justice across Europe.  12. Seeking a phased process of implementation, in which both the UK and the EU institutions and the remaining EU Member States prepare for the new arrangements.   Pre–negotiation meetings [ edit ]  A meeting at 10 Downing Street took place on 6 April 2017 between Theresa May and Donald Tusk to discuss "the way ahead on Brexit". [23] Another meeting took place in London on 20 April 2017, this time between Theresa May and Antonio Tajani to discuss the rights of EU citizens. [24] After the 20 April meeting, Antonio Tajani said that the UK and EU27 timetables fitted well together, with a two-year exit deal negotiation followed by a three-year transition phase. [9] A 10 Downing Street meeting between Theresa May, Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker took place on 26 April to discuss the withdrawal process. May reiterated the UK's aim for a "deep and special partnership" after Brexit. [25]  At a meeting on 29 April 2017 the EU27 unanimously endorsed the draft guidelines with no debate. [13] A meeting took place between Michel Barnier and both houses of the Irish parliament on 11 May, where Barnier assured members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann that Europe would "work with you to avoid a hard border". [26] Barnier went on to say that "the Irish border issue would be one of his three priorities in the negotiations," and that "there is always an answer". [27]  The UK retains its full EU rights until Brexit, and the EU is seeking to increase their budget, leading to the possibility that Britain may veto EU budget increases, which in the immediate term amount to 4 billion euros. A continued British veto would have far-reaching consequences and "will hurt us" according to German MEP Jens Geier. [28]  Negotiation phase 1: withdrawal arrangements [ edit ]  June 2017 [ edit ]  On 19 June 2017, David Davis arrived in Brussels to start negotiations with Michel Barnier. [29] Terms of reference were agreed, and dates were set for four-week cycles, to culminate in a fifth round of negotiations in the week commencing 9 October. Negotiating groups were established for three topics: citizens' rights, the financial settlement and "other separation issues", with a separate dialogue on Ireland / Northern Ireland to be led by Barnier and Davis. [30] [31]  July [ edit ]  Four days of talks, largely between officials, were held in Brussels on 17–20 July. Progress was made in understanding each other's positions. [32]  On citizens' rights, a joint paper compared the positions of the two parties in tabular form. [33] On Irish border issues, both parties stated that they remained committed to the Good Friday Agreement . [32] Michel Barnier called for clarification from the UK in the August round on the financial settlement, citizens’ rights and Ireland, including on how the UK intends to maintain the Common Travel Area . [34]  August [ edit ]  Talks were held in Brussels on 28–31 August. Agreement was reached on points including protecting the rights of frontier workers (those living in one country and working in another); recognition by the UK of social security contributions made both before and after exit; and continuation of healthcare reimbursement for UK citizens who are in the EU27 on exit day and vice versa. [35] The joint paper comparing the two parties' positions was updated. [33]  Speaking at the conclusion of the talks, Michel Barnier highlighted two areas of disagreement: the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing citizens' rights, and the extent of the UK's financial obligations. He stated "Time is passing quickly" and added that "at the current speed, we are far from being able to recommend to the European Council that there has been sufficient progress in order to start discussions on the future relationship". [36]  September [ edit ]  On 7 September the EU Task Force published guiding principles for the dialogue on Ireland / Northern Ireland which reiterated and expanded the principles given in the 29 April guidelines, in particular the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the continuation of the Common Travel Area. [37]  The fourth round of talks began on 25 September, having been delayed by one week as Theresa May was due to deliver a speech in Florence on the 22nd. [38] She proposed a transitional "implementation period" of "around two years" and said that the UK "will honour commitments" so as to not make other EU countries pay more or receive less during the current EU budget period. [39]  The programme for the round of talks arranged for meetings between the "Principals" and for three negotiating groups covering citizens’ rights, financial settlement and other separation issues, while Northern Ireland issues would be addressed by the "Coordinators", and governance of the withdrawal agreement was also for discussion at technical level. [40]  David Davis repeated Theresa May's request for a time-limited implementation period. The UK offered to incorporate the Withdrawal Agreement into UK law and ensure the UK courts can refer directly to it, but there was no agreement on the role of the European Court of Justice and the standing of future ECJ case law. [41]  Mr Barnier welcomed the UK's commitment regarding payments into the current EU budget plan, but expressed reservations about obligations beyond 2020. Mr Davis said the UK was not yet in a position to quantify its commitments. [41]  There were constructive discussions on the Irish border, but no substantive progress. [42]  The UK accepted the EU's definition of 'citizens lawfully resident before the cut off date', although that date was not agreed. There was agreement on the definitions of permanent and temporary residence. The UK offered a more generous "right of return" (after absence for longer than two consecutive years) than the minimum rights under current EU law. Rights of future family members remains a point of disagreement. The joint paper comparing the two parties' positions was again updated. [33]  October [ edit ]  The fifth round of negotiations was held on 9, 10 and 12 October. There was technical progress on citizens' rights, although divergences remained on aspects of family reunion and the export from the UK of social security benefits. [43] The UK stated an intention to offer a simple process for registration of EU citizens. On the Irish border, work continued to map out current areas of cooperation and build a picture of the future challenges. [44]  On the financial settlement, Michel Barnier welcomed the commitment made by Theresa May in her Florence speech, but no negotiations took place because the UK was not ready to give details of what it would pay. Barnier said this issue had reached an impasse. [45]  This round of talks completed the timetable agreed in June, [30] with no further rounds scheduled. [46] [47]  November [ edit ]  Further talks were held in Brussels on 9 and 10 November. [48] Speaking at the closing press conference, Michel Barnier confirmed that clarification on financial commitments by the UK was required within the next two weeks. [49] If the informal deadline is not met, the next phase of negotiations will not start in December, said Barnier. [50] EU diplomats have described the situation as a " chicken and egg dilemma", as the EU will only start working on transition guidelines if Britain makes progress on financial issues by the end of November 2017. [51] By 17 November, however, Donald Tusk said there was no deadlock in talks between Britain and the EU following a meeting with Theresa May in Gothenburg, Sweden and that he was optimistic that negotiations could move on to the next phase in December. [52]  Discussions on the financial settlement took place later in the month, led by Oliver Robbins for the UK and Sabine Weyand for the EU. [53]  December 2017 [ edit ]  Negotiations between officials led to a draft agreement which was expected to be finalised at a meeting between Jean-Claude Juncker and Theresa May in Brussels on 4 December. There was progress on the financial settlement and citizens' rights, but the meeting was abandoned after Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party objected to arrangements for the Irish border; the agreement had earlier received the support of Leo Varadkar , Ireland’s Taoiseach (prime minister). [54]  Talks continued on the following days, leading to publication on 8 December of a joint report setting out the commitments to be reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement. "Agreement in principle" was reached on the three areas:   protecting the rights of Union citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the Union  the framework for addressing the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland  the financial settlement. [55]   A joint technical note gave details of the consensus on citizens' rights. [56] Topics postponed to a later phase included:   rights of UK citizens resident in an EU27 country on the withdrawal date to move to another EU27 country, and their right to return to the UK  recognition of professional qualifications, beyond those already mutually recognised at the withdrawal date.   Juncker described the agreement as a "breakthrough" Brexit deal. [57] The second phase of negotiations – concerning Britain's post-Brexit trade with the EU – will now be able to take place as a result of the agreement. [58] [59]  January 2018 [ edit ]  Discussions on the outstanding issues continued and were described as "low-key". [60]  February 2018 [ edit ]  Several meetings took place between the negotiators. [61]  [62]  March 2018 [ edit ]  The joint report agreed by both sides stated that the UK would maintain regulatory alignment with the EU to prevent a hard border.  Due to the ambivalence of UK on the question of Ireland, Tusk declared in March 2018 "We know today that the UK Government rejects a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, the EU single market, and the customs union," [63] . Tusk's answer to this issue is 'Ireland first'.  Negotiation phase 2: transitional arrangements [ edit ]  Main article: Brexit transition accord  The second phase of the negotiation covers the arrangements for transition towards the UK's withdrawal, together with the framework for the future relationship.  On 15 December 2017, the European Council adopted guidelines for this phase. The document confirmed that progress in the first phase was "sufficient", while stating that commitments made in that phase must be "translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible"; and notes the UK's proposal for a transition period of "around two years". [64] On 20 December, the European Commission published a draft of the negotiating directives stating a transition period should not last beyond 31 December 2020. During the transition the United Kingdom would not be part of agreements the EU made on behalf of its members with third countries, such as CETA . [65]  The European Council adopted and published negotiating directives on 29 January 2018. These state that the whole of the EU acquis (the rights and obligations binding on all member states) will continue to apply to the UK during the transition period. The UK will continue to be within the customs union and the single market, while no longer participating in EU decision-making. [66] The UK's position was outlined in speeches and interviews. [67]  In March 2018 resolution, the MEPs expect an EU-UK agreement which safeguard the framework of existing commercial relationships between the EU and third countries with consistency for keeping a tuned tariff and quota system and rules of origin for products vis-à-vis third and a countries [68] , and also a transitional arrangements fully compatible with WTO obligations to not disrupt trade relations with third countries [68] .  On 19 March 2018, the transition period has been agreed while it can not be considered legally binding until after ratification of a wider agreement on withdrawal: "Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed," [69] .  On 19 March 2018, the document was published; text in green has been agreed. [70] (75% agreed) [71] .   green areas include citizens rights and the financial settlement.  white areas concern police and judicial cooperation.  in yellow: The Northern Ireland border representing the agreement struck in December but the lack of clarity on what that could mean in practic [72] .   A curious development with this release was the avoidance of mentioning what will happen with the free movement rights of UK citizens living abroad on the basis of those rights. The section which previously stated that those rights would be removed, article 32, was removed from the agreement, although references to it remain in other parts of the document.  Detailed history of negotiations [ edit ]  On 28 June 2016, five days after the referendum, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel announced to the German parliament the forthcoming EU negotiation position: the UK could only remain in the European Single Market (ESM) if the UK accepted EU migrants. There would be no cherrypicking ( Rosinenpicken – raisin picking) of the ESM's four conditions (free movement of goods, capital, services and labour). While she expected the UK to remain an important NATO partner, the EU's priority was unity and self-preservation. She warned the UK not to delude itself. [73] The next day, Tusk confirmed that the UK would not be allowed access to the ESM unless they accepted its four freedoms of movement for goods, capital, services, and people. [74]  In contrast, at her October 2016 party conference, Prime Minister Theresa May emphasised that ending the jurisdiction of EU law and free movement from Europe were priorities. She wished "to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the Single Market – and let European businesses do the same here", but not at the expense of losing sovereignty. [75] [76]  In November 2016, May proposed that Britain and the other EU countries mutually guarantee the residency rights of the 3.3 million EU immigrants in Britain and those of the 1.2 million British citizens living on the Continent, in order to exclude their fates being bargained during Brexit negotiations. [77] Despite initial approval from a majority of EU states, May's proposal was blocked by European Council President Tusk and German Chancellor Merkel. [78]  In January 2017, the Prime Minister presented 12 negotiating objectives and confirmed that the UK government would not seek permanent single market membership . [79] The European Parliament's lead negotiator Guy Verhofstadt responded that there could be no "cherry-picking" by the UK in the talks. [80]  The statutory period for negotiation began on 29 March 2017, when the letter notifying withdrawal, signed by the British Prime Minister, was handed to the president of the European Council. The letter called for a "deep and special relationship" between the UK and the EU, and warned that failure to reach an agreement would result in EU-UK trade under World Trade Organisation terms, and a weakening of the UK's cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism. The letter suggested prioritising an early deal on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa. In the letter, the Prime Minister reasoned that, as the EU leaders did not wish "cherry picking" of the ESM, the UK would not seek to remain within the ESM. Instead, the UK would seek a free trade agreement with the EU. [81] In response, Merkel insisted that the EU would not discuss future cooperation without first settling the divorce, Verhofstadt referred to the letter as "blackmail" with regard to the point on security and terrorism, and EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK's decision to quit the block was a "choice they will regret one day". [82]  On 29 April 2017, immediately after the first round of French presidential elections, the EU27 heads of state accepted, without discussion, [83] negotiating guidelines prepared by the President of the European Council . [84] The guidelines take the view that Article 50 permits a two-phased negotiation, whereby the UK first needs to agree to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, before the EU27 will entertain negotiations on a future relationship. [85] In the requested first phase of the withdrawal negotiation, the EU27 negotiators demand the UK pay a "divorce bill", initially estimated as amounting up to £52bn and then, after additional financial demands from Germany, France, and Poland, amounting to £92bn. [86] Nevertheless, a report of the European Union Committee of the House of Lords published on 4 March 2017 states that if there is no post-Brexit deal at the end of the two-year negotiating period, the UK could withdraw without payment. [87] Similarly, the Prime Minister insisted to EU Commission President Juncker that talks about the future UK-EU relationship should start early and that Britain did not owe any money to the EU under the current treaties. [88]  On the EU27 side, unflattering details of a four-way meeting between Prime Minister Theresa May, Brexit Minister David Davis, EU Commission President Juncker and his chief-of-staff Martin Selmayr were leaked to the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung , presumably by Martin Selmayr. [89] According to the leaked description, Juncker claimed that Theresa May was "living in another galaxy" when suggesting that British and EU migrant rights could be rapidly negotiated and agreed in the course of June 2017. German Chancellor Angela Merkel concurred the next day by stating that there were "illusions" on the British side. [88] A few days later, Juncker disclaimed responsibility and called the leak a mistake, Der Spiegel magazine reported that Angela Merkel was annoyed with Juncker for the leak, while European Council President Tusk admonished participants to use discretion during the negotiations. [90] The background for German nervousness allegedly is the possibility that Britain may veto EU budget increases, which for example in the immediate term amount to 4 billion euros. A continued British veto would have far-reaching consequences and "will hurt us" according to German MEP Jens Geier. [91]  On 22 May 2017, the European Council authorised its negotiators to start the Brexit talks and it adopted its negotiating directives. [92] The first day of talks took place on 19 June, where Davis and Barnier agreed to prioritise the question of residency rights, while Davis conceded that a discussion of the Northern Irish border would have to await future trade agreements. [93]  On 22 June 2017, Prime Minister May guaranteed, at a European Council meeting in Brussels, that no EU citizen living legally in the UK would be forced to leave, and she offered that any EU citizen living in the UK for more than 5 years until an unspecified deadline between March 2017 and March 2019 would enjoy the same rights as a UK citizen, conditional on the EU providing the same offer to British expatriates living in the EU. The EU leaders did not immediately reciprocate the offer, with Council President Tusk objecting that the European Council is not a forum for the Brexit negotiations, and Commission president Juncker stating "I’m not negotiating here." [94]  The Prime Minister detailed her residency proposals in the House of Commons on 26 June 2017, but drew no concessions from EU negotiators, [95] who had declined to expedite agreement on expatriates by the end of June 2017, [89] and who are hoping for European courts to continue to have jurisdiction in the UK with regards to EU citizens, according to their negotiation aims published in May 2017. [96] [97]  The second round of negotiations began in Brussels in mid-July 2017. It is considered the beginning of substantial negotiations, with 98 UK negotiators and 45 EU27 negotiators. [98] Progress is being made on the Northern Irish border question, whereas UK negotiators have requested a detailed breakdown of the "divorce bill" demand estimated at 65 billion euros, while the EU negotiators criticise the UK's citizenship rights offer. [99] At the concluding press conference, David Davis did not commit to a net payment by the UK to the EU with regards to the requested divorce bill, while Michel Barnier explained that he would not compromise on his demand for the European Court of Justice to have continuing jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit, [100] rejecting the compromise proposal of a new international body made up of British and EU judges. [101]  On 16 August 2017, the British government disclosed the first of several papers detailing British ambitions following Brexit, discussing trade and customs arrangements. [102] On 23 August 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Britain will leave the EU Court of Justice's direct jurisdiction when the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019 ends, but that both the British courts and the EU Court of Justice will also keep "half an eye" on each other's rulings afterwards as well. [103] One of the UK government's position papers published in August called for no additional restrictions for goods already on the market in the UK and EU. [104]  The third round of negotiations began in Brussels on 28 August 2017. The European Commission president Juncker criticised the UK's Brexit negotiations, saying none of the papers provided so far were satisfactory and that there would be no trade negotiations between the EU and UK until the divorce bill was settled. He had previously claimed that the UK's Brexit bill could be £55bn (which Theresa May's government ministers consider unacceptable) [104] and EU Budget Commissioner Günther Oettinger voiced the view that the UK should make payments until 2023. [105] The Irish Times explained the disagreement as follows: British negotiators referred to the seven-year Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF or Maff) for the period 2014-2020 agreed by member states and the EU parliament as a "planning tool" for the next period rather than a legally-binding financial obligation on member states. The British case is that the MFF sets ceilings on spending under various headings and is later radically revised during the annual budget process when real legal obligations on each state arises. This contrasts with the EU Commission's methodology for calculating the UK Brexit bill which involves dividing the MFF into the shares historically agreed by each member state. [106] On the Irish border question there was a "breakthrough", with the British side guaranteeing free movement of EU citizens within the Common travel area constituting Ireland and the United Kingdom. [107] The BBC's Europe correspondent commented "the British perception of the talks is more positive than the EU's". [104]     The Ambrosetti Forum is held annually in the Villa d'Este on the shores of Lake Como in Italy.    At the elite European Ambrosetti Forum on 2 September 2017, Michel Barnier explained his negotiation aims, in that he would "teach the British people and others what leaving the EU means". [108] Although this remark caused controversy in the UK, BBC correspondent Mark Mardell interpreted it in the context of French and Dutch euroscepticism, of the forthcoming German, Austrian and Italian elections, and of the eurosceptic Polish and Hungarian governments. [109]  In a statement to Parliament on 5 September 2017, David Davis said that "concrete progress" had been made over the summer in areas such as protecting the rights of British expats in the EU to access healthcare and over the future of the Irish border, while significant differences over the "divorce bill" remain. [110] He expected that "the money argument will go on for the full duration of the negotiation. The famous European “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” will apply here absolutely, as anywhere else". [111]  On 6 September 2017, Prime Minister May announced that new immigration controls will be placed on EU nationals when Brexit concludes. [112]  On 9 September 2017, the EU Commission published several negotiating papers, including "Guiding Principles on the Dialogue for Ireland/Northern Ireland". In it, the EU concedes/declares that it is the responsibility of the UK to propose solutions for the post-Brexit Irish border. The paper envisages that a "unique" solution would be permissible here; in other words, any such exceptional Irish solution should not be seen as a template for post-Brexit relationships with the other EU members on border and customs control matters, for example ETIAS . [113]  At the European Council meeting of 19/20 October 2017, the 27 leaders of the EU states were to decide whether or not to start trade negotiations with the UK. [104] However, David Davis has conceded that so soon after the German elections on 24 September, a German coalition government may not be in place in time for making this decision in October, delaying any European Council decision until their December meeting. [114] [19]  On 21 September 2017, Prime Minister May, along with her Cabinet, [115] agreed to a transition deal which would inject 20bn euros to the EU budget over a two-year period. [116] A cabinet source confirmed to the BBC that May's Cabinet was in fact unity around the Prime Minister's two year transition deal. [116]  On 22 September 2017, May announced the details of her Brexit proposal during a speech in Florence, Italy . [117] [118] In addition to offering 20 billion euros over a two-year transition period and continued acceptance of European immigrants, [119] she also offered a "bold new security relationship" with the EU which would be "unprecedented in its depth" and to continue to make "an ongoing contribution" to projects considered greatly to the EU and UK's advantage, such as science and security projects. [118] [117] She also confirmed that the UK would not "stand in the way" of Juncker's proposals for further EU integration. [118] [117] The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed May's proposal as "constructive," [120] but that it also "must be translated into negotiating positions to make meaningful progress;" [120] Similarly, President of France Emmanuel Macron was adamant that the EU would not begin negotiations on future EU-UK relationships until "the regulation of European citizens, the financial terms of the exit, and the questions of Ireland" were "clarified" by the UK, [121] though he also acknowledged that May did give openings in her speech on two of these three points. [122] Ireland Taoiseach Leo Varadkar gave May's proposal a "cautious welcome," saying that while it was good of May to reference the Common Travel Area, the Northern Ireland peace process and that both sides in the negotiations do not want any physical structures at the border, more negotiations were needed for clarification. [123] EU Parliamentary negotiator Guy Verhofstadt responded that "a new registration mechanism for EU citizens going to live and/or work in the UK is out of the question". [124]  EU negotiators have stated that an agreement must be reached between Britain and the EU by October 2018 in order to leave time for national parliaments to endorse Brexit. [120]  On the domestic front, Labour Party MP and Shadow Home Secretary  Diane Abbott announced she would back May's proposed negotiation for the Brexit timetable. [125]  The programme for the fourth round of talks beginning on 25 September arranged for meetings between the "Principals" and for three negotiating groups covering citizens’ rights, financial settlement and other separation issues, while Northern Ireland issues would be addressed by the "Coordinators", and governance of the withdrawal agreement would be discussed at technical level. [40]  On 16 October, May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker issued a joint statement agreeing Brexit talks should "accelerate over the months to come" following a dinner meeting in Brussels, Belgium which both described as "constructive and friendly." [126] [127] [128] [129] However, as at a similar dinner earlier in 2017, an unflattering "impressionistic" account of this meeting (between Prime Minister Theresa May, her chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins, Brexit Minister David Davis, EU Commission President Juncker and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier) was published in the same German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung . Again, Juncker's chief-of-staff Martin Selmayr was accused as the source of the publication and of trying to undermine the negotiations. This time however Selmayr denied the accusation, and Chancellor Merkel reportedly denied her involvement. [130] [131]  On 17 October, Brexit Secretary David Davis insisted that there will be no deal for a transition phase without EU cooperation and that Brexit will happen regardless, even if there is what one Conservative MP described as "a bridge to nowhere." [132]  On 19 October, the first day of the two-day European Council meeting in Brussels, Belgium May issued a direct message to approximately three million EU citizens living in Britain, promising she will make it as easy as possible for them to stay after Brexit. [133] On 20 October, Tusk described media reports of the deadlock in Brexit talks as "exaggerated." [134]  On 23 October, May announced to the House of Commons that Brexit talks underwent "important progress" during her recent meeting with the European Council and that Britain was now "in touching distance" of a trade deal with EU countries, [135] [136] while also reiterating that no transition phase will take place following the conclusion of Brexit without a trade deal as well. [137] The same day, Juncker denied reports by the German media that May had "begged for help" during their recent dinner meeting. [138]  In the wake of the German elections (23 September 2017), as of 10 November, negotiations were still ongoing to form a coalition government between Frau Merkel's CDU, the sister party CSU, the economically liberal FDP and the German Greens; politicians from all three factions published an appeal to reach a coalition agreement (rather than risk new elections), in the interest of Germany forming a "stable anchor" to unite with France and defend the EU and the euro in the current situation. [139]  During the sixth round of meetings in Brussels between UK and EU negotiators on 9–10 November, Michel Barnier set the UK a deadline of two weeks to specify a divorce bill that the UK would pay, without which the UK would not be permitted to start trade negotiations in December 2017. Meanwhile, David Davis rejected an EU proposal that Northern Ireland could remain in the EU customs union (thereby creating a customs border with mainland Britain). [140]  After more than 2 months of a caretaker German government since the German federal elections in September, on 7 Dec 2017 new elections were averted when the German socialist party under Martin Schulz agreed to negotiate a coalition government with Angela Merkel 's Christian Democrat party, but on condition that a "United States of Europe" be created by 2025, dismissing those EU member states who were unwilling to participate. [141]  The following day (8 December), the UK and EU negotiators agreed on the principle that "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" and formally announced to proceed immediately to the next phase of talks on a transition period and future trade relationships. [142] [143]  The EU’s negotiating position as at 10 November was that a future trade relationship between EU and UK should be made conditional upon requirements which would handicap the UK’s freedom to negotiate free trade deals with the rest of the world; and that no free trade deal can be agreed in parallel with the Article 50 withdrawal agreement because each of the 27 EU countries would be expected to veto it if they would otherwise face competition from the UK on tax, employment conditions, safety regulations and relaxation of restrictions on GM crops; and that the EU would require any transitional deal to be signed as part of a withdrawal agreement before any agreement was in place on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, so that existing arrangements would continue to apply during any transitional period, with the Single Market, Customs Union and European Court of Justice having the same roles as at present, and preventing the UK having control of EU immigration during that period or having the right to enter into trade deals with other countries. [144]  Legality of and payments by the UK to the EU [ edit ]  Two different but incompatible legal approaches would be considered for the Brexit. The EU approach is top down while the British approach is bottom-up. This difference of approach raises a serious problem of confidence. [145] From Michel Barnier point of view, what was decided by 28 member states, has to be paid by 28 member states till the end. [145]  The issue of payments by the UK to the EU as part of the exit agreement is subject to much conjecture and has been divided into two broad questions. Firstly, whether a leaving state is legally obligated to contribute to the EU budget beyond its membership period or compensate for any financial losses that EU may suffer on account of withdrawal, given that Article 50 does not concern itself with financial ramifications of a withdrawal; and secondly – if the United Kingdom is legally obligated to pay – what should be the due amount.  The leaders of France and Germany have both stated that the UK would need to agree terms regarding the departure before discussing future relationships. [146] This has been reinforced by EU27 guidelines issued to the remaining 27 countries. [147] The UK has signalled that it may consider paying the EU to attain preferential access to the economic Single Market and may offer to pay liabilities, even if not legally obligated, on a moral and co-operative basis to secure a preferential working relationship with the EU. [148]  The highest reported claim by the EU is around €60 billion (£50 billion [ when? ] ). In March 2017 the Bruegel think tank estimated that the UK would need to pay at least €25.4 billion, but the method of calculation is debatable and their calculations using seven different methods produced estimates between €30 and €45 billion. [149] However this £50 billion bill includes the United Kingdom's annual EU contribution (approximately £13 billion annually) for the two years from 2020 and 2021 as agreed in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). [ citation needed ] The United Kingdom, in accordance with Article 50 and unless otherwise extended, will cease to be a member of the EU from 29 March 2019 and the MFF does have a provision for "unforeseen circumstances".  EU27 is expected to ask the UK to pay its liabilities in euros, including the relocation costs associated with the two EU bodies currently based in London. [150]  Speaking on 20 April, Antonio Tajani said that it was too early to quantify the amount the UK would need to pay and that it was not a bill to leave the EU, it was money needed for farmers and small businesses. [9]  House of Lords report [ edit ]    "27. It may seem intuitive that when the UK leaves the EU, it leaves behind both the responsibilities and benefits of membership. However, this does not take account of the complexity of the UK’s participation in the EU, nor of the procedures for agreeing current and future budgets, which involve mutual commitments projected many years into the future. ...33. The range of values in circulation for the UK’s potential ‘exit bill’ indicates that the absolute sum of any posited settlement is hugely speculative. Almost every element is subject to interpretation."   HL Paper 125, 4 March 2017, European Union Committee15th sessional report, Brexit and the EU budget , Chapter 3, Potential demands . [8]   A March 2017 House of Lords report acknowledges that the EU may claim for (1) part of the current budget (which runs from 2014 to 2020) post March 2019, because it was approved by the UK (2) part of the EU future commitments which amount to €200 billion and (3) a contribution if the UK is to continue with access to some EU programmes. [151] The report concluded that the UK had no legal obligation to make "exit" payments to the EU if there was no post Brexit deal. [152] [87]  Discussing financial and legal complexities involved in negotiating withdrawal, including settlement of outstanding financial liabilities and division of assets, the report mentions (paragraph 15) that the EU budget is funded by revenue drawn from various sources, governed by the EU’s Own Resources Decision (ORD), which was made part of UK law by the European Union (Finance) Act 2015 . [153] The revenue includes contributions from import duties and VAT collected by member states. The report also mentions the EU Multiannual Financial Framework for controlling the annual expenditure.  Assets and liabilities [ edit ]  The EU has considerable assets including buildings, equipment and financial instruments, and there is a potential claim by the UK for a portion of these assets. [149]  Boris Johnson , the UK's Foreign Secretary , commenting on the Brexit "divorce bill" in May 2017 stated that the valuable EU assets the UK has paid for over the years should be properly valued, and that there were good arguments for including them in the negotiations. [154]  The Bank of England (BoE) has invested in the European Central Bank (ECB) amounting to 13.6743%, representing paid up capital of €55.5million. The BoE does not participate in any profits (or losses) of the ECB. [155] The BoE has also made loans to the ECB. The ECB set up the European Financial Stability Facility in 2010, which has a borrowing facility of €440bn and in addition used a guarantee from the European Commission and the Budget of the European Union as collateral to borrow a further €60bn. The UK withdrawal will affect the ECB.  The EU has a pension liability of €64 billion. [151]  The UK benefits from a rebate which reduces its contribution to the EU budget . The rebate is paid a year in arrears, accordingly the 2019 rebate would be payable in 2020. [151]  Policy paper [ edit ]        This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards . The specific problem is: Vague, POV problems, and gm  Please help improve this section if you can.  (June 2017)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Some EU institution drafted a 10-page position document regarding the single bill. This position does not define the final cost of the divorce, but provide some elements such as the name of first identified EU bodies which might be concerned by the single bill. Those bodies includes around 40 agencies, eight joint projects on new technologies and a panoply of funds agreed by all countries, including aid for refugees in Turkey to supporting peace in Colombia. As an EU member, Britain is also involved in the funding of teachers for the elite European schools that educate EU civil servants’ children. this document should be discussed on Tuesday and Thursday by the side wher (Great-)Britain is not. [79] The EU has promised to publish key Brexit documents, a decision that is both transparency pledge and negotiating tactic. [79]  UK citizens elsewhere in the EU and other EU citizens in the UK [ edit ]  Concerns have been raised by UK citizens who live in other EU countries, and by citizens from those countries who live in the UK. In May 2017, Michel Barnier stated: "Currently around 3.2 million EU citizens work and live in the UK, and 1.2 million British citizens work and live in the EU." [156]  Issues include rights of movement, citizenship, abode, education, social support and medical treatment, and the payment of pensions; and the extent to which these rights apply to family members. [157] Considerations for UK citizens resident in an EU27 country include their rights to work or live in a different EU27 country. [158] Beyond the 27 EU countries, workers have certain freedom of movement rights to/from Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.  "Associate citizenship", suggested by EU27 negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, would allow UK nationals to volunteer individually for EU citizenship, enabling them to continue to work and live on the continent. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, is not opposed to the idea. [159]  Antonio Tajani spoke after a meeting with Theresa May on 20 April, saying "the issue of reciprocal EU citizen rights should be negotiated 'immediately' with a view to getting an agreement by the end of the year." [9] The European Commission published a position paper on "Essential Principles on Citizens' Rights" on 12 June, proposing that current and future family members of European nationals in the UK would keep their rights to settle in their residence country at any time after Britain's withdrawal. [160] Speaking in advance of publication of the paper, David Davis described the demands as "ridiculously high". [161] The UK government published their policy paper "Safeguarding the position of EU citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the EU" on 26 June. [162] The policy paper proposed that EU citizens living in Britain will be required to apply for inclusion on a "settled status" register if they wish to remain in the country after Brexit. [163]  At end of September progress have been made on several of the 60 points which became green. In the same time there around 13 out of the 60 points which remain red. Three points (points #14, #15, and #16 related to monitoring and CJEU) have to be addressed at governance level. Few points remains to clarify (that is yellow). [164] On this basis European parliament will have to assess if sufficient progress have been made.  Implications [ edit ]  The general rule for losing EU citizenship is that European citizenship is lost if member state nationality is lost, [165] but the automatic loss of EU citizenship as a result of a member state withdrawing from the EU is the subject of debate. [166] The situation of a person acquiring EU citizenship when the UK joined the EU in 1973 compared to a person born in the UK after 1973 and was therefore born into EU citizenship may differ. It may be necessary for the European Court of Justice to rule on these issues.  A 2017 decision of the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that where a child is born in the EU, the parent/s, even if they are both non EU citizens, are entitled to rights of residence. This could have consequential effects for UK residents who have young children and wish to live in the EU27 territory post Brexit. [167]  Immigration and mobility [ edit ]  Until the UK effectively withdraws from the EU in 2019 or at another agreed date, the current system of free movement of labour between the EU27 and the UK remains in place.  The report of the House of Commons Exiting the European Union Committee on The Government's negotiating objectives , published in April 2017, [168] proposed (paragraphs 20 and 123) that the future system for EU migration should meet the needs of different sectors of the UK economy, including those employing scientists, bankers, vets, care workers, health service professionals and seasonal agriculture workers.  Theresa May , answering press questions on 5 April 2017, commented that the free movement of labour would not end in March 2019; an implementation period of possibly five years would give business and government time to adjust. [169]  The UK currently charges an annual levy of up to £1,000 for each non-EU citizen employed within the UK. [170] Proposals are under consideration to increase this 'immigration skills charge' to £2,000 p.a. and to implement a similar levy on EU citizens employed in the UK. [171] [172]  According to an unconfirmed newspaper report, a leaked Home Office paper has a proposal that the UK will end the free movement of labour of low-skilled workers immediately after Brexit, focusing on highly skilled EU workers instead. [173] [174] The proposal would limit lower-skilled EU migrants' residency permits to a maximum of two years, and the implementation of a new immigration system ending the right to settle in Britain for most European migrants while placing tough restrictions on their rights to bring over family members. [173] Those in "high-skilled occupations" could be given permission to work in the UK for a period of three to five years. [173]  Immigration [ edit ]  Immigration is one topic requiring partnership between EU and UK, as according to Theresa May, "Mass migration and terrorism are but two examples of the challenges to our shared European interests and values that we can only solve in partnership". [175]  In the context of Brexit, the question of migration might contains two subtopics: on one hand migrations between EU including UK and third countries which might be dealt with at a local level; and on the other hand migration between EU and UK once UK has become a third country which was discussed for the withdrawal agreement.  European Court of Justice [ edit ]  The concept of European Court of Justice competence creates complications. Some pro-Brexiteers believe the Court of Justice might be completely removed from the UK landscape. Various other opinions consider that the Court of Justice or some equivalent should be able to rule on remaining issues after Brexit (for instance between a European and a British stakeholder), at least in respect of the TEU ( Treaty on European Union ), European Union citizens , or access to the European Single Market . [176]  After the 2017 negotiations, in February 2018 the European Commission Draft Withdrawal Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community [177] consider for instance that:   ″The Court of Justice of the European Union shall continue to have jurisdiction for any proceedings brought before it by the United Kingdom or against the United Kingdom before the end of the transition period. That jurisdiction shall extend to all stages of proceedings, including appeal proceedings before the Court of Justice and proceedings before the General Court after a case has been referred back to it. ″  ″The Court of Justice of the European Union shall continue to have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on requests from courts and tribunals of the United Kingdom referred to it before the end of the transition period.″   Sectoral issues [ edit ]  Brexit might have impact in various sectors. [178]  Documents setting out how the Brexit will affect parts of the British economy were set up for the government, "the most comprehensive picture of our economy on this issue" containing "excruciating detail" according to Brexit Secretary David Davis. The ministers were reluctant to publish them but in November, a vote in Parliament allowed lawmakers to read them under controlled conditions to avoid news leaks . They were released online on 21 December 2017 but lawmakers were unimpressed: "Most of this could be found on Wikipedia or with a quick Google search ," said Labour's David Lammy , "these documents [were made] in a couple of weeks. They look like copy and paste essay crises." [179]  Trade [ edit ]  Without a trade agreement in place, the World Trade Organization rules would apply to trade between the UK and the EU. This would lead to common tariffs being imposed by the EU27 upon the UK's access to the European Single Market , because the Market is also a customs union . However, the UK would then have an opportunity to control immigration as well as develop its own trade regulations.  The UK is not permitted to hold trade talks until after Brexit is concluded, however the UK can do preparatory work with other countries regarding the UK's future trading relationships; this is not to the liking of some EU27 countries. [180] Before Britain leaves the EU, they may put trade agreements in place with non-EU countries.(de Mars,S.,Murray,C.R.G.,O`Donoghue,A.and Warwick,B.T.,2016.)  Only the EU can act in areas where it has exclusive competence, such as the customs union and common commercial policy. In those areas Member States may not act independently. [181] The UK can still negotiate its own bilateral investment protection treaties subject to Commission authorization. [181]  Strategic controls on military goods are primarily a Member State competence. As a result, Member States themselves negotiate multilateral or bilateral agreements on the strategic aspects of trade in defense goods. [181]  The EU27 wish to exclude the UK from sitting in on trade negotiations held by the EU during the period ending March 2019, seeing the UK as a competitor. Theresa May rejected this idea, saying "While we're members of the European Union we would expect our obligations but also our rights to be honored in full." [180]  Regional foods [ edit ]  Further information: List of United Kingdom food and drink products with protected status  The Geographical indications and traditional specialties in the European Union , known as protected designation of origin (PDO) is applied internationally via bilateral agreements. Without an agreement with the EU27, UK producers of products such as the Cornish pasty , Scotch whisky and Jersey Royal potatoes are at risk of being copied.  Fisheries [ edit ]  The EU27 have stated that UK fish suppliers could lose tariff-free access to the continent unless EU countries have continued access to UK waters after Brexit. [182]  Agriculture  The Irish agricultural sector is heavily dependent on UK markets for its exports.  Financial services [ edit ]  Banks [ edit ]  Investment banks may want to have new or expanded offices up and running inside the EU27 bloc before the UK's departure in March 2019, with Frankfurt and Dublin the possible favourites. [183] Ireland's investment arm, IDA Ireland, witnessed an increase in inquiries from London-based financial groups considering to open up on an office in Dublin by the end of 2016, mostly coming from North American companies. In May 2017, JP Morgan became the first major bank to officially choose Dublin to transfer some of its personnel and operations from its London office. [184]  Insurance [ edit ]  Lloyd's of London have confirmed that they will open a subsidiary in Brussels, hoping to ensure continuation of their continental business which generates 11% of its premiums. [185]  Asset management companies [ edit ]  The situation may be different when it comes to the fund management industry, as British asset owners, notably UK pension funds , often constitute an incommensurate share of total turnover for German, French, Dutch and other Continental European asset managers.  This imbalance could potentially give Britain some negotiating leverage e.g. power of retorsion in case the EU attempts to impose an abrupt cancellation of the mutually-binding obligations and advantages pertaining to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 ( "fund passporting" ). Research conducted by the World Pensions Council (WPC) shows that   “Assets owned by UK pension funds are more than 11 times bigger than those of all German and French pension funds put together […] If need be, at the first hint of threat to the City of London, Her Majesty’s Government should be in a position to respond very forcefully.” [186]   Stock exchanges [ edit ]  The London Stock Exchange issued a warning over a proposal by the EU, to allow euro-denominated transactions to be cleared only within the EU eurozone , claiming it would increase business costs by €100bn over 5 years and isolate the euro capital market. [187]  Security [ edit ]  The letter of 29 March 2017 giving the UK's notice of intention to withdraw from the EU stated "In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened." [6] This was seen by some as a threat. [188] On 31 March, Boris Johnson , the UK Foreign Secretary, confirmed that the "UK commitment to EU security is unconditional". [189]  The call by the United States to other members of NATO to increase their defence expenditure to the 2% of GDP level coincides in timing with Brexit. The UK is the second largest contributor to NATO defence, one of only five to meet the 2% level and one of only two EU members who have nuclear weapons. The possibility of a new Franco-German partnership to fill the vacuum left by Britain has been raised as a possibility and post Brexit an EU military headquarters, previously vetoed by the UK, may be created. [190] The UK is fully committed to NATO.  Academic research [ edit ]  Main article: Brexit and arrangements for science and technology  The UK government's negotiating policy when the negotiating period started on 29 March 2017 included remaining at the vanguard of science and innovation, and seeking continued close collaboration with the UK's European partners.  British Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies [ edit ]  In the Great Repeal Bill  white paper published on 30 March 2017, the UK government stated "The Government is committed to engaging with the Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and the other Overseas Territories as we leave the EU." [191] : ch.5  Overseas territories [ edit ]  Robin Walker  MP , a junior minister at the Department for Exiting the European Union, is responsible for managing the relationship between the overseas territories and Parliament in their discussion with the EU27. [192]  Gibraltar [ edit ]  Main article: Gibraltar after Brexit  Brexit raised issues around sovereignty for Gibraltar , the only British Overseas Territory in the EU. [193] Gibraltarians voted to stay in the European Union by 96%. [194] Spain claims sovereignty over Gibraltar; however, in 2002 Gibraltarians voted 99% to keep British sovereignty .  The EU27 draft guidelines allow Spain a veto over any effect that the Brexit agreement has as regards Gibraltar. The guidelines state: "After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom." [195]  Crown dependencies [ edit ]  The Crown dependencies are neither part of the EU nor of the UK. They have a unique constitutional relationship both with the UK and, as encapsulated in Protocol 3 to the UK’s Treaty of Accession , with the EU. [196] They have no voting rights in EU or UK referenda or elections and no international voice, the UK government having the responsibility to act for the dependencies on foreign matters. Oliver Heald  QC  MP is responsible for managing the relationship between the Islands and Parliament in their discussion with the EU27. [197]  The "no deal" scenario [ edit ]  If no withdrawal agreement is in place by the end of the two-year period under Article 50, the EU Treaties will cease to apply to the UK. [198] This has been described by a lawyers' interest body as "falling over the cliff-edge". [199]  A Parliamentary inquiry has concluded that "the possibility of 'no deal' is real enough to justify planning for it. The Government has produced no evidence, either to this inquiry or in its White Paper, to indicate that it is giving the possibility of 'no deal' the level of consideration that it deserves, or is contemplating any serious contingency planning. This is all the more urgent if the Government is serious in its assertion that it will walk away from a 'bad' deal." [200]  The UK government has consistently said that it will aim for the "best possible deal" but that "no deal is better than a bad deal". This position was restated in the Conservative Party manifesto for the 2017 general election. [201] In July, Michel Barnier said that "a fair deal is better than no deal", because "In the case of Brexit, 'no deal' is a return to a distant past". [202]  Aviation would be particularly affected if the European Common Aviation Area and EU–US Open Skies Agreement no longer applied to the UK after a "no-deal" Brexit, since World Trade Organisation rules do not cover that sector, [203] implying that the following day a British plane could not land at an EU airport. [204]  In September 2017 the BBC reported that there was little evidence of UK government preparations for a "No Deal" scenario: "our government is not behaving like it is really preparing for No Deal – and the EU27 can surely see it." [205]  In her 4 October 2017 speech at the Conservative Party Conference, UK Prime Minister Theresa May repeated her position that "no deal is better than a bad deal" and emphasized that "It is our responsibility as a government to prepare for every eventuality. And let me reassure everyone in this hall – that is exactly what we are doing." [206]  In her 9 October 2017 statement in the House of Commons, May warned that Britain could operate as an "independent trading nation" after Brexit if no trade deal is reached with the EU. [207]  The question of no deal makes some civil servant — Sir Martin Donnelly — not sure to understand what no deal means: [208] While no deal makes trade only dependant on World Trade Organisation terms which do not include services — 80% of the British economy —, he believes that No deal "could mean an awful lot of legal uncertainty and that’s very bad for businesses, for jobs, for investment in Britain". [208]  According to some people, the delivery of a no deal Brexit could raise support for a second independence referendum in Scotland. Such hypothesis is provided by the Scottish Centre on European Relations in its paper: «Brexit Uncertainty, Scotland and the UK in 2018». [209]  Nonetheless, according to John McDonnell — Shadow Chancellor — there are enough people in the House of Commons to prevent some no-agreement exit. [210]  According to Dominic Cummings — Vote Leave — "If there’s no deal, there will be significant problems that were completely avoidable". [211]          * Source, Olivier Wayman report, La Tribune [212] pounds have been converted to euros, on 12 March 2018    The deep & special relationship scenario [ edit ]  The UK side has called for a deep and special relationship between UK and EU. [213] [214] [215]  Possibility of an extended transitional period [ edit ]  Most of the major UK political parties support the idea two years period for applying temporary trade arrangements after the end of the membership of the EU single market, customs union and other EU agreements and before a stand-alone UK. [216]  According to Michel Barnier , the EU might have to define the conditions for a transitional period, if the UK request one. [217] Such a transition period would begin on 30 March 2019 (European time, as Brexit occurs at midnight the day before). [217]  According to Michel Barnier, the transition period is submitted to a withdrawal agreement, by law written in Article 50 . [217]  Future trade deal between UK and EU [ edit ]  While negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union were in progress, Barnier, as the EU's chief negotiator, speaking in Rome to Committees of the Italian Parliament on 21 September 2017, stated that a future trade deal with the United Kingdom is the trade deal which will be negotiated after sufficient progress has been done on the withdrawal deal. Barnier commented that the EU will want to negotiate a future trade deal with the United Kingdom, because trade with the United Kingdom will continue. [218] At the same time Barnier said "the future trade deal with the United Kingdom will be particular, as it will be less about building convergence, and more about controlling future divergence. This is key to establishing fair competition." [218]  The United Kingdom's prime minister, in a speech at the Santa Maria Novella church in Florence on 22 September 2017, [219] proposed an economic partnership between the UK and the EU which respects both the freedoms and principles of the EU, and the wishes of the British people. At the same time she re-affirmed that after the UK leaves the EU a period of implementation would be in their mutual interest, to be agreed under Article 50 for a strictly time-limited period. [220]  The European parliament voted a Brexit resolution (the European Parliament resolution of 14 March 2018 on the framework of the future EU-UK relationship (2018/2573(RSP)) with 544 MEP against 110 (with 51 abstentions [221] ). The 14 pages [68] document states that an association agreement between EU and UK could be an adequate framework for the future. This resolution propose that the agreement address 4 domains: trade, interior security, foreign and defense policy collaboration, and thematic cooperation (for instance for research and innovation) [222]  ·  [223] . The resolution also urges the UK to present a clear position on all outstanding issues pertaining to its orderly withdrawal [68] .

Afonso Henriques's anxiety at this incursion at his southern frontier hastened his negotiations with Alfonso VII of León after Valdevez, leading to the Treaty of Zamora and freeing Afonso Henriques's troops to deal with the Muslim attack.  Battle [ edit ]  Historians are divided as to the location of this battle. At the time, the name "Ourique" designated a large area south of Beja . Since 12th century chroniclers were unfamiliar with the region where the battle took place, they might have decided to call the location "field of Ourique" for lack of a more precise term. [1] Nonetheless, the great distance that separated Ourique from the Christian lines farther north has led some historians to suggest various localities in central Portugal, abandoning the traditional idea that the combat occurred in Ourique in the Alentejo . [2] It would have been difficult for the then Count of Portugal, with a realm little beyond the Mondego River , to go all the way south to battle five Moorish Kings. One plausible alternative is Vila Chã de Ourique, located some ten miles from Santarém . [3]  However, incursions by Christian armies deep in Muslim territory were not unheard-of. Alfonso VII had directed expeditions that had reached Cordoba and Seville , well beyond the limits of Castillian dominions, and in 1147 he managed to conquer the Mediterranean port of Almería , south of Granada. This was possible because the largest Almoravid armies were positioned at the frontier, while armies stationed in small towns would rather retreat into their castles than face a strong enemy force. It is not at all unfeasible that Afonso lead a raid into the Gharb , and then, while retreating, was intercepted by sizable Almoravid troops intending to crush his army. [4]  Despite the fact that the Christian Portuguese forces were strongly outnumbered, the Muslim armies were weakened by internal leadership problems, which led to Afonso Henriques's victory and subsequently his proclamation as King of the Portuguese , as Afonso I , with the support from his troops, vanquishing and slaying, so legend says, five Moorish kings. [5] [6] [7]  The earliest accounts provide little detail. In one account the Moorish forces are led by five Kings ( Life of St. Theotonius ), while in another, the Muslim forces are under the command of one King, Ismar ( Chronicles ). [3] In the more detailed Chronicle of the Goths , Ismar waited until Henriques penetrated into Moslem territory, then systematically sent his troops from Seville , Badajoz , Elvas , Évora and Beja against the Portuguese count. [3] Further, the Portuguese forces were surrounded on the hilltop where they encamped, Ismar hosted knights, who were executed later by Henriques, and that the Moorish king escaped in defeat. [3] Arab and Spanish accounts do not clarify the circumstances, and confuse the issue, identifying the Ismar as, alternatively, Ismar Abuzicri or Ismar and Abuzicri, with later historians identifying Abu Zakariya , the governor of Santarém, as the protagonist. [3] It is also likely that the numbers were inflated by the chroniclers from a large-scale raid to grand assault by Muslim forces. [3]  Aftermath [ edit ]     Primitive Portuguese Coat-of-Arms    It was presumed that after his victory over the five Moorish kings, the nobles acclaimed Afonso Henriques as king. [8] In reality, documents after his victory continued to refer to Henriques as Prince or Infante. [8] [9]  Immediately after the battle, Afonso Henriques is said to have called for the first assembly of the estates-general ( Portuguese : Cortes Gerais ) of Portugal at Lamego , where he was given the Crown from the Bishop of Braga , to confirm the Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of León . This was a patriotic falsification perpetuated by the clergy, nobility and supporters who promoted the Restoration of Portuguese sovereignty and the claims of John IV , after the Iberian Union . [10] The documents that refer to the estates-general were "deciphered" by Cistercian monks from the Monastery of Alcobaça to perpetuate the myth and justify the legitimacy of the Portuguese crown in the 17th century. The author of this falsification was Oliveira Marques, and even in 1632 [11] there were misgivings about the validity of the chronicler's account or the existence of the Cortes of Lamego [12] The account continued to support the notion that in the 12th century a meeting of the Cortes occurred in the Church of Santa Maria de Almacave, in Lamego, in 1143. [10] During this meeting, after being acclaimed by estates-general, Afonso Henriques accepted a group of laws on royal succession and excluded the Castilian line of Kings from the Portuguese throne, made provisions for the nobility, on justice and the independence of Portugal. [10] But, even as Spanish jurists and diplomats later demonstrated that the document was uncreditable, the Portuguese defended the authenticity of the account. [13]  Alexandre Herculano later recounted the patriotic re-imagining in his História de Portugal , which caused its own controversy, and was later perpetuated by the writings of Alfredo Pimenta (who defended the existence of the Cortes of Lamego). [13]  In commemoration of the Battle of Ourique, the first Portuguese coat-of-arms appeared that included five small shields, to represent the five defeated Moorish kings (from one interpretation), which was later challenged by many authors.  Legend [ edit ]     The vision of D. Afonso Henriques    Some years later, the idea of a miraculous intervention in the battle by Saint James in favor of the Portuguese appeared in the chronicles of the battle. Saint James was widely venerated in Iberia (with a main center of veneration in Santiago de Compostela , in Galicia , where his tomb was believed to be located), being generally seen as the Matamouros (English: Moor -slayer ). As a consequence of Portuguese independence this legend was embellished with time, in order to distance the Portuguese from Spanish devotional practices and beliefs. Later interpretations replaced Saint James with Saint George [ citation needed ] and, finally, with Jesus Christ . [ citation needed ]  In the legend, Afonso Henriques is visited before the battle by an old man who saw in a dream that Henriques would be victorious because God would intervene in his favour. [8] He advised the nobleman to leave the encampment alone when he heard the bell of the local chapel. [8] Riding off he was surprised by a ray of light that showed him (in one interpretation) the sign of the cross and Jesus Christ on a crucifix. [8] Afonso Henriques knelt in its presence and heard the voice of Christ who told him he would defeat the Moors, which he, through courage and his faith, succeeded the following day. [8]  The legend of the miracle of the Battle of Ourique served thus as a political instrument to defend Portuguese independence as divine will. Yet, the legend, possibly earlier, knows his first known record in the early 15th century by the monks of the Monastery of Santa Cruz , during the battles between John and the Kingdom of Castile. [8] Some modern authors claim that it is a creation of the monks, or forged by these, [8] while not presenting evidence to support their theory, being, according to others, a long popular and royal belief tradition. [14] It was in 1419 that the legend first appeared in the Crónica de Portugal , and was accepted as fact, until Alexandre Herculano first reexamined the event, judging it a "pious fraud", in his investigation in the middle of the 19th century.

(August 2014)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )       ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Anthony Bozza is a New York City -based author and journalist who has written extensively for Rolling Stone and other magazines. He is also the author of bestselling books on Eminem , AC/DC and Artie Lange . Since 2005 he has co-authored numerous autobiographies of artists including Slash , INXS , and Tommy Lee .     Contents    1  Career  2  Bibliography   2.1  Non-fiction  2.2  As co-author    3  References  4  External links     Career [ edit ]  Bozza started his career as an intern in 1995 at Rolling Stone , fact-checking, coffee-fetching and doing research for other writers before they hired him full-time in the music department. He answered phones, edited columns and did the odd story, but his big break came after a friend turned him on to an unsigned white rapper from Detroit named Eminem. That tape of a live Eminem freestyle was unlike anything he’d ever heard. He began talking the rapper up to his editors, who told him that if Eminem ever got signed they would let Anthony write a short blurb about him. A year later, Bozza wrote the first national cover story on Eminem.  Bozza wrote six more cover stories, numerous features, and countless other articles during his seven-year tenure at Rolling Stone . He wrote and edited the “Random Notes” section for two years, joining the ranks of “Random Notes” alumni like Cameron Crowe and MTV's Kurt Loder .  In 2002 he left the magazine to write Whatever You Say I Am: The Life and Times of Eminem , which was born of the unparalleled access and hours he had spent with Eminem while working on his Rolling Stone features and beyond. Janet Maslin , culture critic at the New York Times, wrote that it was a “compelling” investigation of the “Shadyfication of America.” The book was a New York Times bestseller and an international bestseller, topping lists in England, Germany, France and South America.  Bozza followed this up by co-writing memoirs with various musicians and other celebrities. His first such book was with Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee , the New York Times Bestseller Tommyland . A biography of Australian legends INXS followed. Then came what Rolling Stone ranked one of the top 5 rock autobiographies of all time, the New York Times Bestseller Slash , co-written with the notoriously taciturn Guns N' Roses guitarist.  Bozza moved into the comedy world next, with the autobiography of stand-up veteran and Howard Stern co-host Artie Lange, Too Fat to Fish . The book debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and remained there for twenty-two weeks. Bozza returned to music analysis with his next book, the critically acclaimed Why AC/DC Matters , which inspired a series of "Why _ Matters" books in AC/DC’s native Australia, Bozza’s tome being Volume 1. Two more co-writes followed: I Am the New Black , the autobiography of comedian Tracy Morgan , and Purpose , with Wyclef Jean of the Fugees .  Anthony Bozza has also written for magazines and newspapers worldwide, including Spin, Maxim, The New York Times, The Guardian/Observer (UK), Q, Mojo, Paper, Nylon, Blender, Radar and Playboy. In 2010, along with writer Neil Strauss, he embarked on a three-year experiment in publishing and launched Igniter Literary Group, an imprint of Harper Collins’ It Books.  Bozza and Artie Lange co-wrote another book, Crash and Burn , in 2013, which recounts Lange’s lifelong struggle with drug addiction and depression and his near suicide. In 2015, Bozza co-wrote Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood 's memoir, Play On: Now, Then, and Fleetwood Mac .  Bozza worked with Courtney Love to co-write her memoir, tentatively titled Girl with the Most Cake , but the experience ended in acrimony. Bozza submitted Love a manuscript in 2014 that he was quite pleased with, later calling it "possibly the greatest thing I’ll ever do with anybody". [1] Love, however, disliked it, and said in an interview that the text made her sound like she was "jacked on coffee and sugar in a really bad mood". [2] Love refused to pay Bozza for the work he had done, and he sued her in 2015 for lack of payment.

While officially an extended play , it was treated as a studio album when released. According to the RIAA , the album has sold over five million copies in the United States. It was their last album to feature drummer Steven Adler. " Patience " was the only single released from Lies ; it peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 . [7]     Contents    1  Background and recording  2  Artwork  3  Track listing  4  Personnel  5  References     Background and recording [ edit ]  The first four tracks consist of the previously released EP  Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide . The last four songs were recorded with acoustic guitars . They were written and recorded in only a few studio sessions (with the exception of "You're Crazy," which appeared in an alternate version on Appetite for Destruction ), which producer Mike Clink called "one of those magical rock and roll history moments."  In later interviews, Axl Rose stated that while he loved how the band sounded on the last four songs, he hated the sound of his voice. Rose recalled that his voice was husky and scratchy from the band's lengthy touring at the time, and if he could he would have re-recorded his vocal tracks in a separate session.  A significantly faster version of "You're Crazy" with electric guitars had previously been released on the band's debut album, Appetite for Destruction , and was now recorded as originally intended. [8] " Mama Kin " is an Aerosmith song, which appears on that band's 1973 debut album . "Nice Boys" is a Rose Tattoo cover from their 1978 self-titled debut album . " Used to Love Her " was written as a joke after Izzy Stradlin disliked a song he heard on the radio featuring "some guy whining about a broad who was treating him bad". Slash stated that "People think it's about one of our old girlfriends, but it's actually about Axl's dog." [9]  Artwork [ edit ]     The original cover art for the album with the original text appearing in full.    The cover is a humorous parody of tabloid  newspapers , as are the liner notes . The album's cover art underwent several minor modifications when the title was released on CD. [10] First, in the bottom left corner reading "LIES LIES LIES" originally read " Wife-beating has been around for 10,000 years." Secondly, instead of "Elephant gives birth to midget", the original headline reads, "Ladies, welcome to the dark ages." Many copies of the original LP release also contained an uncensored picture of a nude model on the inner LP sleeve. [11]  The UK/Euro WX 218 924 198 - 1 release had 2 stickers on the cover; Special Limited Edition containing Sheet of Japanese Peel off Stickers, and Contains language that some people may find offensive 924 198 - 1. The Peel off Stickers are on a 21mm x 30mm sheet.  The cover art bears a resemblance to John Lennon 's Some Time in New York City , an album that contains Lennon's controversial " Woman Is the Nigger of the World ", a song Axl Rose cited when he defended his use of the word "nigger" in " One in a Million ".

"Arthur Pendragon" redirects here. For other uses, see Arthur Pendragon (disambiguation) .     Tapestry showing Arthur as one of the Nine Worthies , wearing a coat of arms often attributed to him [1] (c. 1385 )    King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances , led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries AD. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians. [2] The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae , the Historia Brittonum , and the writings of Gildas . Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin . [3]  Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain . The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth 's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ). [4] In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld , Annwn . [5] How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.  Although the themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical version; Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain , Ireland , Iceland , Norway and Gaul . Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia , including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon , the wizard Merlin , Arthur's wife Guinevere , the sword Excalibur , Arthur's conception at Tintagel , his final battle against Mordred at Camlann , and final rest in Avalon . The 12th-century French writer Chrétien de Troyes , who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature . In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table . Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend lives on, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media.

One school of thought, citing entries in the Historia Brittonum ( History of the Britons ) and Annales Cambriae ( Welsh Annals ), sees Arthur as a genuine historical figure, a Romano-British leader who fought against the invading Anglo-Saxons some time in the late 5th to early 6th century. The Historia Brittonum , a 9th-century Latin historical compilation attributed in some late manuscripts to a Welsh cleric called Nennius , contains the first datable mention of King Arthur, listing twelve battles that Arthur fought. These culminate in the Battle of Badon , where he is said to have single-handedly killed 960 men. Recent studies, however, question the reliability of the Historia Brittonum . [7]  The other text that seems to support the case for Arthur's historical existence is the 10th-century Annales Cambriae , which also link Arthur with the Battle of Badon. The Annales date this battle to 516–518, and also mention the Battle of Camlann , in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) were both killed, dated to 537–539. These details have often been used to bolster confidence in the Historia 's account and to confirm that Arthur really did fight at Badon. Problems have been identified, however, with using this source to support the Historia Brittonum' s account. The latest research shows that the Annales Cambriae was based on a chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales . Additionally, the complex textual history of the Annales Cambriae precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it even that early. They were more likely added at some point in the 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals. The Badon entry probably derived from the Historia Brittonum . [8]  This lack of convincing early evidence is the reason many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain . In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards , "at this stage of the enquiry, one can only say that there may well have been an historical Arthur [but ...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him". [9] These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland , The Age of Arthur (1973). Even so, he found little to say about an historical Arthur. [10]     The 10th-century Annales Cambriae (from a copy c. 1100 )    Partly in reaction to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all. Morris's Age of Arthur prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that "no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian's time". [11]  Gildas ' 6th-century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae ( On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain ), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur. [12] Arthur is not mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820. [13] He is absent from Bede 's early-8th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People , another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon. [14] The historian David Dumville has written: "I think we can dispose of him [Arthur] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought ... The fact of the matter is that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books." [15]  Some scholars argue that Arthur was originally a fictional hero of folklore—or even a half-forgotten Celtic deity —who became credited with real deeds in the distant past. They cite parallels with figures such as the Kentish  Hengist and Horsa , who may be totemic horse-gods that later became historicised. Bede ascribed to these legendary figures a historical role in the 5th-century Anglo-Saxon conquest of eastern Britain. [16] It is not even certain that Arthur was considered a king in the early texts. Neither the Historia nor the Annales calls him " rex ": the former calls him instead " dux bellorum " (leader of battles) and " miles " (soldier). [17]  Historical documents for the post-Roman period are scarce, so a definitive answer to the question of Arthur's historical existence is unlikely. Sites and places have been identified as "Arthurian" since the 12th century, [18] but archaeology can confidently reveal names only through inscriptions found in secure contexts . The so-called " Arthur stone ", discovered in 1998 among the ruins at Tintagel Castle in Cornwall in securely dated 6th-century contexts, created a brief stir but proved irrelevant. [19] Other inscriptional evidence for Arthur, including the Glastonbury cross , is tainted with the suggestion of forgery. [20] Although several historical figures have been proposed as the basis for Arthur, [21] no convincing evidence for these identifications has emerged.  Name  Main article: Arthur  The origin of the Welsh name "Arthur" remains a matter of debate. Some suggest it is derived from the Roman nomen gentile (family name) Artorius , of obscure and contested etymology [22] (but possibly of Messapian [23] [24] [25] or Etruscan origin). [26] [27] [28] Some scholars have suggested it is relevant to this debate that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as Arthur , or Arturus , in early Latin Arthurian texts, never as Artōrius (though Classical Latin Artōrius became Arturius in some Vulgar Latin dialects). However, this may not say anything about the origin of the name Arthur , as Artōrius would regularly become Art(h)ur when borrowed into Welsh . [29]  Another possibility is that it is derived from a Brittonic patronym *Arto-rīg-ios (the root of which, *arto-rīg- "bear-king" is to be found in the Old Irish personal name Art-ri ) via a Latinized form Artōrius. [30] Less likely is the commonly proposed derivation from Welsh arth "bear" + (g)wr "man" (earlier *Arto-uiros in Brittonic); there are phonological difficulties with this theory—notably that a Brittonic compound name *Arto-uiros should produce Old Welsh *Artgur and Middle/Modern Welsh *Arthwr and not Arthur (in Welsh poetry the name is always spelled Arthur and is exclusively rhymed with words ending in -ur – never words ending in -wr – which confirms that the second element cannot be [g]wr "man"). [31] [32]  An alternative theory, which has gained only limited acceptance among professional scholars, derives the name Arthur from Arcturus , the brightest star in the constellation Boötes , near Ursa Major or the Great Bear. [33]  Classical Latin  Arcturus would also have become Art(h)ur when borrowed into Welsh, and its brightness and position in the sky led people to regard it as the "guardian of the bear" (which is the meaning of the name in Ancient Greek ) and the "leader" of the other stars in Boötes. [34]  A similar first name is Old Irish  Artúr , which is believed to be derived directly from an early Old Welsh or Cumbric  Artur . [35] The earliest historically attested bearer of the name is a son or grandson of Áedán mac Gabráin (d. AD 609). [36]  Medieval literary traditions  The creator of the familiar literary persona of Arthur was Geoffrey of Monmouth , with his pseudo-historical Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ), written in the 1130s. The textual sources for Arthur are usually divided into those written before Geoffrey's Historia (known as pre-Galfridian texts, from the Latin form of Geoffrey, Galfridus ) and those written afterwards, which could not avoid his influence (Galfridian, or post-Galfridian, texts).  Pre-Galfridian traditions     A facsimile page of Y Gododdin , one of the most famous early Welsh texts featuring Arthur (c. 1275 )    The earliest literary references to Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There have been few attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre- Galfridian tradition as a whole, rather than in a single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. [37] The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum , but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters , destructive divine boars , dragons , dogheads , giants , and witches . [38] The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. [39] The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn . On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin. [40]  One of the most famous Welsh poetic references to Arthur comes in the collection of heroic death-songs known as Y Gododdin ( The Gododdin ), attributed to 6th-century poet Aneirin . One stanza praises the bravery of a warrior who slew 300 enemies, but says that despite this, "he was no Arthur" – that is, his feats cannot compare to the valour of Arthur. [41]  Y Gododdin is known only from a 13th-century manuscript, so it is impossible to determine whether this passage is original or a later interpolation, but John Koch's view that the passage dates from a 7th-century or earlier version is regarded as unproven; 9th- or 10th-century dates are often proposed for it. [42] Several poems attributed to Taliesin , a poet said to have lived in the 6th century, also refer to Arthur, although these all probably date from between the 8th and 12th centuries. [43] They include "Kadeir Teyrnon" ("The Chair of the Prince"), [44] which refers to "Arthur the Blessed"; " Preiddeu Annwn " ("The Spoils of Annwn"), [45] which recounts an expedition of Arthur to the Otherworld; and "Marwnat vthyr pen[dragon]" ("The Elegy of Uther Pen[dragon]"), [46] which refers to Arthur's valour and is suggestive of a father-son relationship for Arthur and Uther that pre-dates Geoffrey of Monmouth.      Culhwch entering Arthur's court in the Welsh tale " Culhwch and Olwen " (1881) [47]    Other early Welsh Arthurian texts include a poem found in the Black Book of Carmarthen , " Pa gur yv y porthaur? " ("What man is the gatekeeper?"). [48] This takes the form of a dialogue between Arthur and the gatekeeper of a fortress he wishes to enter, in which Arthur recounts the names and deeds of himself and his men, notably Cei (Kay) and Bedwyr (Bedivere). The Welsh prose tale Culhwch and Olwen (c. 1100 ), included in the modern Mabinogion collection, has a much longer list of more than 200 of Arthur's men, though Cei and Bedwyr again take a central place. The story as a whole tells of Arthur helping his kinsman Culhwch win the hand of Olwen , daughter of Ysbaddaden Chief-Giant, by completing a series of apparently impossible tasks, including the hunt for the great semi-divine boar Twrch Trwyth . The 9th-century Historia Brittonum also refers to this tale, with the boar there named Troy(n)t. [49] Finally, Arthur is mentioned numerous times in the Welsh Triads , a collection of short summaries of Welsh tradition and legend which are classified into groups of three linked characters or episodes to assist recall. The later manuscripts of the Triads are partly derivative from Geoffrey of Monmouth and later continental traditions, but the earliest ones show no such influence and are usually agreed to refer to pre-existing Welsh traditions. Even in these, however, Arthur's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with "Arthur's Court" sometimes substituted for "The Island of Britain" in the formula "Three XXX of the Island of Britain". [50] While it is not clear from the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time Culhwch and Olwen and the Triads were written he had become Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon , "Chief of the Lords of this Island", the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North. [51]  In addition to these pre-Galfridian Welsh poems and tales, Arthur appears in some other early Latin texts besides the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae . In particular, Arthur features in a number of well-known vitae (" Lives ") of post-Roman saints , none of which are now generally considered to be reliable historical sources (the earliest probably dates from the 11th century). [52] According to the Life of Saint Gildas , written in the early 12th century by Caradoc of Llancarfan , Arthur is said to have killed Gildas' brother Hueil and to have rescued his wife Gwenhwyfar from Glastonbury. [53] In the Life of Saint Cadoc , written around 1100 or a little before by Lifris of Llancarfan, the saint gives protection to a man who killed three of Arthur's soldiers, and Arthur demands a herd of cattle as wergeld for his men. Cadoc delivers them as demanded, but when Arthur takes possession of the animals, they turn into bundles of ferns. [54] Similar incidents are described in the medieval biographies of Carannog , Padarn , and Eufflam, probably written around the 12th century. A less obviously legendary account of Arthur appears in the Legenda Sancti Goeznovii , which is often claimed to date from the early 11th century (although the earliest manuscript of this text dates from the 15th century). [55] Also important are the references to Arthur in William of Malmesbury 's De Gestis Regum Anglorum and Herman's De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudensis , which together provide the first certain evidence for a belief that Arthur was not actually dead and would at some point return , a theme that is often revisited in post-Galfridian folklore. [56]  Geoffrey of Monmouth      Mordred , Arthur's final foe according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, illustrated by H. J. Ford (1902)       King Arthur. A crude illustration from a 15th-century Welsh language version of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia Regum Britanniae    The first narrative account of Arthur's life is found in Geoffrey of Monmouth 's Latin work Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ), completed c. 1138 . [57] This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader . Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae . He incorporates Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon , his magician advisor Merlin , and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna at Tintagel , and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum , culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands . After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway , Denmark and Gaul . Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory naturally leads to a further confrontation between his empire and Rome's. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again. [58]      Merlin , Arthur's advisor (c. 1300 ) [59]    How much of this narrative was Geoffrey's own invention is open to debate. Certainly, Geoffrey seems to have made use of the list of Arthur's twelve battles against the Saxons found in the 9th-century Historia Brittonum , along with the battle of Camlann from the Annales Cambriae and the idea that Arthur was still alive . [60] Arthur's personal status as the king of all Britain would also seem to be borrowed from pre-Galfridian tradition, being found in Culhwch and Olwen , the Triads , and the saints' lives . [61] Finally, Geoffrey borrowed many of the names for Arthur's possessions, close family , and companions from the pre-Galfridian Welsh tradition, including Kaius (Cei), Beduerus (Bedwyr), Guenhuuara (Gwenhwyfar), Uther (Uthyr) and perhaps also Caliburnus (Caledfwlch), the latter becoming Excalibur in subsequent Arthurian tales. [62] However, while names, key events, and titles may have been borrowed, Brynley Roberts has argued that "the Arthurian section is Geoffrey's literary creation and it owes nothing to prior narrative." [63] So, for instance, the Welsh Medraut is made the villainous Modredus by Geoffrey, but there is no trace of such a negative character for this figure in Welsh sources until the 16th century. [64] There have been relatively few modern attempts to challenge this notion that the Historia Regum Britanniae is primarily Geoffrey's own work, with scholarly opinion often echoing William of Newburgh 's late-12th-century comment that Geoffrey "made up" his narrative, perhaps through an "inordinate love of lying". [65]  Geoffrey Ashe is one dissenter from this view, believing that Geoffrey's narrative is partially derived from a lost source telling of the deeds of a 5th-century British king named Riotamus , this figure being the original Arthur, although historians and Celticists have been reluctant to follow Ashe in his conclusions. [66]  Whatever his sources may have been, the immense popularity of Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae cannot be denied. Well over 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey's Latin work are known to have survived, and this does not include translations into other languages. [67] Thus, for example, around 60 manuscripts are extant containing Welsh-language versions of the Historia , the earliest of which were created in the 13th century; the old notion that some of these Welsh versions actually underlie Geoffrey's Historia , advanced by antiquarians such as the 18th-century Lewis Morris, has long since been discounted in academic circles. [68] As a result of this popularity, Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae was enormously influential on the later medieval development of the Arthurian legend. While it was by no means the only creative force behind Arthurian romance, many of its elements were borrowed and developed (e.g., Merlin and the final fate of Arthur), and it provided the historical framework into which the romancers' tales of magical and wonderful adventures were inserted. [69]  Romance traditions     During the 12th century, Arthur's character began to be marginalised by the accretion of "Arthurian" side-stories such as that of Tristan and Iseult . By John William Waterhouse (1916)    The popularity of Geoffrey's Historia and its other derivative works (such as Wace 's Roman de Brut ) is generally agreed to be an important factor in explaining the appearance of significant numbers of new Arthurian works in continental Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly in France. [70] It was not, however, the only Arthurian influence on the developing " Matter of Britain ". There is clear evidence that Arthur and Arthurian tales were familiar on the Continent before Geoffrey's work became widely known (see for example, the Modena Archivolt ), [71] and "Celtic" names and stories not found in Geoffrey's Historia appear in the Arthurian romances . [72] From the perspective of Arthur, perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was on the role of the king himself: much of this 12th-century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere , Percival , Galahad , Gawain , Ywain , and Tristan and Iseult . Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre-Galfridian material and Geoffrey's Historia itself, in the romances he is rapidly sidelined. [73] His character also alters significantly. In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior, who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns, [74] whereas in the continental romances he becomes the roi fainéant , the "do-nothing king", whose "inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society". [75] Arthur's role in these works is frequently that of a wise, dignified, even-tempered, somewhat bland, and occasionally feeble monarch. So, he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere in the Mort Artu , whilst in Chrétien de Troyes 's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion , he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap. [76] Nonetheless, as Norris J. Lacy has observed, whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances, "his prestige is never—or almost never—compromised by his personal weaknesses ... his authority and glory remain intact." [77]     The story of Arthur drawing the sword from a stone appeared in Robert de Boron 's 13th-century Merlin . By Howard Pyle (1903) [78]    Arthur and his retinue appear in some of the Lais of Marie de France , [79] but it was the work of another French poet, Chrétien de Troyes, that had the greatest influence with regard to the development of Arthur's character and legend. [80] Chrétien wrote five Arthurian romances between c. 1170 and 1190. Erec and Enide and Cligès are tales of courtly love with Arthur's court as their backdrop, demonstrating the shift away from the heroic world of the Welsh and Galfridian Arthur, while Yvain, the Knight of the Lion , features Yvain and Gawain in a supernatural adventure, with Arthur very much on the sidelines and weakened. However, the most significant for the development of the Arthurian legend are Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart , which introduces Lancelot and his adulterous relationship with Arthur's queen ( Guinevere ), extending and popularising the recurring theme of Arthur as a cuckold , and Perceval, the Story of the Grail , which introduces the Holy Grail and the Fisher King and which again sees Arthur having a much reduced role. [81] Chrétien was thus "instrumental both in the elaboration of the Arthurian legend and in the establishment of the ideal form for the diffusion of that legend", [82] and much of what came after him in terms of the portrayal of Arthur and his world built upon the foundations he had laid. Perceval , although unfinished, was particularly popular: four separate continuations of the poem appeared over the next half century, with the notion of the Grail and its quest being developed by other writers such as Robert de Boron , a fact that helped accelerate the decline of Arthur in continental romance. [83] Similarly, Lancelot and his cuckolding of Arthur with Guinevere became one of the classic motifs of the Arthurian legend, although the Lancelot of the prose Lancelot (c. 1225 ) and later texts was a combination of Chrétien's character and that of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven 's Lanzelet . [84] Chrétien's work even appears to feed back into Welsh Arthurian literature, with the result that the romance Arthur began to replace the heroic, active Arthur in Welsh literary tradition. [85] Particularly significant in this development were the three Welsh Arthurian romances, which are closely similar to those of Chrétien, albeit with some significant differences: Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain is related to Chrétien's Yvain ; Geraint and Enid , to Erec and Enide ; and Peredur son of Efrawg , to Perceval . [86]     The Round Table experiences a vision of the Holy Grail . By Évrard d'Espinques (c. 1475 ) [87]    Up to c. 1210 , continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. [88] These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail , the Estoire de Merlin , the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot , which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu , which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister and established the role of Camelot , first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot , as Arthur's primary court. [89] This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40 ), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. [88] As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu . During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies , a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon 's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art. [90]     Arthur (top centre) in an illustration to " Sir Gawain and the Green Knight " (late 14th century)    The development of the medieval Arthurian cycle and the character of the "Arthur of romance" culminated in Le Morte d'Arthur , Thomas Malory 's retelling of the entire legend in a single work in English in the late 15th century. Malory based his book—originally titled The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Knights of the Round Table —on the various previous romance versions, in particular the Vulgate Cycle, and appears to have aimed at creating a comprehensive and authoritative collection of Arthurian stories. [91] Perhaps as a result of this, and the fact that Le Morte D'Arthur was one of the earliest printed books in England, published by William Caxton in 1485, most later Arthurian works are derivative of Malory's. [92]  Decline, revival, and the modern legend  Post-medieval literature  The end of the Middle Ages brought with it a waning of interest in King Arthur. Although Malory's English version of the great French romances was popular, there were increasing attacks upon the truthfulness of the historical framework of the Arthurian romances – established since Geoffrey of Monmouth's time – and thus the legitimacy of the whole Matter of Britain . So, for example, the 16th-century humanist scholar Polydore Vergil famously rejected the claim that Arthur was the ruler of a post-Roman empire, found throughout the post-Galfridian medieval "chronicle tradition", to the horror of Welsh and English antiquarians. [93] Social changes associated with the end of the medieval period and the Renaissance also conspired to rob the character of Arthur and his associated legend of some of their power to enthrall audiences, with the result that 1634 saw the last printing of Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur for nearly 200 years. [94] King Arthur and the Arthurian legend were not entirely abandoned, but until the early 19th century the material was taken less seriously and was often used simply as a vehicle for allegories of 17th- and 18th-century politics. [95] Thus Richard Blackmore 's epics Prince Arthur (1695) and King Arthur (1697) feature Arthur as an allegory for the struggles of William III against James II . [95] Similarly, the most popular Arthurian tale throughout this period seems to have been that of Tom Thumb , which was told first through chapbooks and later through the political plays of Henry Fielding ; although the action is clearly set in Arthurian Britain, the treatment is humorous and Arthur appears as a primarily comedic version of his romance character. [96]  John Dryden 's masque  King Arthur is still performed, largely thanks to Henry Purcell 's music, though seldom unabridged.  Tennyson and the revival      Gustave Doré 's illustration of Camelot for Alfred Tennyson 's Idylls of the King (1868) [97]    In the early 19th century, medievalism , Romanticism , and the Gothic Revival reawakened interest in Arthur and the medieval romances. A new code of ethics for 19th-century gentlemen was shaped around the chivalric ideals embodied in the "Arthur of romance". This renewed interest first made itself felt in 1816, when Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur was reprinted for the first time since 1634. [98] Initially, the medieval Arthurian legends were of particular interest to poets, inspiring, for example, William Wordsworth to write "The Egyptian Maid" (1835), an allegory of the Holy Grail . [99] Pre-eminent among these was Alfred Tennyson , whose first Arthurian poem " The Lady of Shalott " was published in 1832. [100] Arthur himself played a minor role in some of these works, following in the medieval romance tradition. Tennyson's Arthurian work reached its peak of popularity with Idylls of the King , however, which reworked the entire narrative of Arthur's life for the Victorian era . It was first published in 1859 and sold 10,000 copies within the first week. [101] In the Idylls , Arthur became a symbol of ideal manhood who ultimately failed, through human weakness, to establish a perfect kingdom on earth. [102] Tennyson's works prompted a large number of imitators, generated considerable public interest in the legends of Arthur and the character himself, and brought Malory's tales to a wider audience. [103] Indeed, the first modernisation of Malory's great compilation of Arthur's tales was published in 1862, shortly after Idylls appeared, and there were six further editions and five competitors before the century ended. [104]  This interest in the 'Arthur of romance' and his associated stories continued through the 19th century and into the 20th, and influenced poets such as William Morris and Pre-Raphaelite artists including Edward Burne-Jones . [105] Even the humorous tale of Tom Thumb , which had been the primary manifestation of Arthur's legend in the 18th century, was rewritten after the publication of Idylls . While Tom maintained his small stature and remained a figure of comic relief, his story now included more elements from the medieval Arthurian romances and Arthur is treated more seriously and historically in these new versions. [106] The revived Arthurian romance also proved influential in the United States, with such books as Sidney Lanier's The Boy's King Arthur (1880) reaching wide audiences and providing inspiration for Mark Twain 's satiric A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889). [107] Although the 'Arthur of romance' was sometimes central to these new Arthurian works (as he was in Burne-Jones's "The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon", 1881-1898), on other occasions he reverted to his medieval status and is either marginalized or even missing entirely, with Wagner's Arthurian operas providing a notable instance of the latter. [108] Furthermore, the revival of interest in Arthur and the Arthurian tales did not continue unabated. By the end of the 19th century, it was confined mainly to Pre-Raphaelite imitators, [109] and it could not avoid being affected by World War I , which damaged the reputation of chivalry and thus interest in its medieval manifestations and Arthur as chivalric role model. [110] The romance tradition did, however, remain sufficiently powerful to persuade Thomas Hardy , Laurence Binyon and John Masefield to compose Arthurian plays, [111] and T. S. Eliot alludes to the Arthur myth (but not Arthur) in his poem The Waste Land , which mentions the Fisher King . [112]  Modern legend     The combat of Arthur and Mordred , illustrated by N. C. Wyeth for Sidney Lanier 's The Boy's King Arthur (1922) [113]    See also: List of works based on Arthurian legends  In the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the romance tradition of Arthur continued, through novels such as T. H. White 's The Once and Future King (1958) and Marion Zimmer Bradley 's The Mists of Avalon (1982) in addition to comic strips such as Prince Valiant (from 1937 onward). [114] Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is often the case with modern treatments too. Bradley's tale, for example, takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials, [115] and American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy. [116] In John Cowper Powys 's Porius: A Romance of the Dark Ages (1951), set in Wales in AD 499, just prior to the Saxon invasion , Arthur. the Emperor of Britain, is only a minor character, whereas Myrddin (Merlin) and Nineue , Tennyson's Vivien, are major figures. [117] Myrdddin's disappearance at the end of the novel is "in the tradition of magical hibernation when the king or mage leaves his people for some island or cave to return either at a more propitious or more dangerous time" (see King Arthur's messianic return ). [118] Also Powys's earlier novel, A Glastonbury Romance (1932) is concerned with both the Holy Grail and the legend that Arthur is buried in the town of Glastonbury . [119]  The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White's novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical Camelot (1960) and Walt Disney 's animated film The Sword in the Stone (1963); Camelot , with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur, was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967. The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and, according to critics, successfully handled in Robert Bresson 's Lancelot du Lac (1974), Éric Rohmer 's Perceval le Gallois (1978) and perhaps John Boorman 's fantasy film Excalibur (1981); it is also the main source of the material used in the Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975). [120]      The Death of Arthur , by John Garrick (1862)    Re-tellings and re-imaginings of the romance tradition are not the only important aspect of the modern legend of King Arthur. Attempts to portray Arthur as a genuine historical figure of c. 500 , stripping away the "romance", have also emerged. As Taylor and Brewer have noted, this return to the medieval "chronicle tradition" of Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Historia Brittonum is a recent trend which became dominant in Arthurian literature in the years following the outbreak of the Second World War , when Arthur's legendary resistance to Germanic invaders struck a chord in Britain. [121]  Clemence Dane 's series of radio plays, The Saviours (1942), used a historical Arthur to embody the spirit of heroic resistance against desperate odds, and Robert Sherriff's play The Long Sunset (1955) saw Arthur rallying Romano-British resistance against the Germanic invaders. [122] This trend towards placing Arthur in a historical setting is also apparent in historical and fantasy novels published during this period. [123] In recent years the portrayal of Arthur as a real hero of the 5th century has also made its way into film versions of the Arthurian legend, most notably the TV series' Arthur of the Britons (1972–73), Merlin (2008–12), The Legend of King Arthur (1979), and Camelot (2011) [124] and the feature films King Arthur (2004), The Last Legion (2007) and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017). [125]  Arthur has also been used as a model for modern-day behaviour. In the 1930s, the Order of the Fellowship of the Knights of the Round Table was formed in Britain to promote Christian ideals and Arthurian notions of medieval chivalry. [126] In the United States, hundreds of thousands of boys and girls joined Arthurian youth groups, such as the Knights of King Arthur, in which Arthur and his legends were promoted as wholesome exemplars. [127] However, Arthur's diffusion within contemporary culture goes beyond such obviously Arthurian endeavours, with Arthurian names being regularly attached to objects, buildings, and places. As Norris J. Lacy has observed, "The popular notion of Arthur appears to be limited, not surprisingly, to a few motifs and names, but there can be no doubt of the extent to which a legend born many centuries ago is profoundly embedded in modern culture at every level."

[4] As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation . [5]  Headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the Pope , the church's doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed . Its central administration, the Holy See , is in the Vatican City , an enclave within Rome , Italy .  The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ , [6] [7] [note 1] that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles , and that the Pope is the successor to Saint Peter to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ. [10] It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith , reserving infallibility , passed down by sacred tradition . [11] The Latin Church , the Eastern Catholic Churches , and institutes such as mendicant orders and enclosed monastic orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the Church. [12] [13]  Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the principal one, celebrated liturgically in the Mass . [14] The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine  become the body and blood of Christ . The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven , honoured in dogmas and devotions . [15] Its teaching includes sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel and Catholic social teaching , which emphasises support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy . The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of education and health care in the world. [16]  The Catholic Church has influenced Western philosophy , culture , science , and art . The Catholic Church shared communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church until the East–West Schism in 1054, disputing particularly the authority of the Pope , as well as with the Oriental Orthodox churches prior to the Chalcedonian schism in 451 over differences in Christology . Catholics live all over the world through missions , diaspora , and conversions . Since the 20th century the majority reside in the southern hemisphere due to secularisation in Europe , and increased persecution in the Middle East . From the late 20th century, the Catholic Church has been criticised for its doctrines on sexuality , its refusal to ordain women and its handling of sexual abuse cases .

[17] He died in Rome , with his relics located in the Basilica of San Clemente al Laterano .    Further information: Catholic (term) and Roman Catholic (term)  Catholic (from Greek : καθολικός , translit.  katholikos , lit.  'universal') was first used to describe the church in the early 2nd century. [18] The first known use of the phrase "the catholic church" ( καθολικὴ ἐκκλησία  he katholike ekklesia ) occurred in the letter written about 110 AD from Saint Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyrnaeans . [note 2] In the Catechetical Lectures ( c. 350 ) of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem , the name "Catholic Church" was used to distinguish it from other groups that also called themselves "the church". [19] [20] The "Catholic" notion was further stressed in the edict De fide Catolica issued 380 by Theodosius I , the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire , when establishing the state church of the Roman Empire . [21]  Since the East–West Schism of 1054, the Eastern Church has taken the adjective "Orthodox" as its distinctive epithet (however, its official name continues to be the "Orthodox Catholic Church" [22] ) and the Western Church in communion with the Holy See has similarly taken "Catholic", keeping that description also after the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, when those who ceased to be in communion became known as "Protestants". [23] [24]  While the "Roman Church" has been used to describe the pope's Diocese of Rome since the Fall of the Western Roman Empire and into the Early Middle Ages (6th–10th century), the "Roman Catholic Church" has been applied to the whole church in English language since the Protestant Reformation in the late 16th century. [25] "Roman Catholic" has occasionally appeared also in documents produced both by the Holy See, [note 3] notably applied to certain national episcopal conferences , and local dioceses. [note 4]  The name "Catholic Church" for the whole church is used in the 1990 Catechism of the Catholic Church , the 1983 Code of Canon Law , the documents of the 1962–65 Second Vatican Council , and numerous other official documents. [26] [27] [28]  Organisation     "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven." Jesus to Peter in the Gospel of Matthew , 16:19  The crossed gold and silver keys of the Holy See symbolise the keys of Simon Peter , representing the power of the papal office to loose and bind. The triple crown papal tiara symbolises the triple power of the Pope as "father of kings", "governor of the world" and "Vicar of Christ". The gold cross on a monde ( globe ) surmounting the tiara symbolises the sovereignty of Jesus .    Main articles: Hierarchy of the Catholic Church and Catholic Church by country  The Catholic Church follows an episcopal polity , led by bishops who have received the sacrament of Holy Orders who are given formal jurisdictions of governance within the church. [29] [30] There are three levels of clergy, the episcopate, composed of bishops who hold jurisdiction over a geographic area called a diocese or eparchy ; the presbyterate, composed of priests ordained by bishops and who work in local diocese or religious orders; and the diaconate, composed of deacons who assist bishops and priests in a variety of ministerial roles. Ultimately leading the entire Catholic Church is the Bishop of Rome, commonly called the pope, whose jurisdiction is called the Holy See . In parallel to the diocesan structure are a variety of religious institutes that function autonomously, often subject only to the authority of the pope, though sometimes subject to the local bishop. Most religious institutes only have male or female members but some have both. Additionally, lay members aid many liturgical functions during worship services.  Holy See, papacy, and the Roman Curia      Francis is the 266th and current Pope of the Catholic Church, a title he holds ex officio as Bishop of Rome , and sovereign of Vatican City . He was elected in the papal conclave, 2013 .        Archbasilica of St. John Lateran , the Cathedral for the Diocese of Rome    Main articles: Holy See , Pope , and Roman Curia  Further information: List of popes  The hierarchy of the Catholic Church is headed by the Bishop of Rome , known as the pope ( Latin : papa ; "father"), who is the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. [31] The current pope, Francis , was elected on 13 March 2013 by papal conclave . [32]  The office of the pope is known as the papacy . The Catholic Church holds that Christ instituted the papacy upon giving the keys of Heaven to Saint Peter . His ecclesiastical jurisdiction is called the " Holy See " ( Sancta Sedes in Latin), or the " Apostolic See " (meaning the see of the apostle Peter). [33] [34] Directly serving the pope is the Roman Curia , the central governing body that administers the day-to-day business of the Catholic Church.  The pope is also Sovereign of Vatican City , [35] a small city-state entirely enclaved within the city of Rome, which is an entity distinct from the Holy See. It is as head of the Holy See, not as head of Vatican City State, that the pope receives ambassadors of states and sends them his own diplomatic representatives. [36] The Holy See also confers orders, decorations and medals , such as the orders of chivalry in the Middle Ages.  While the famous Saint Peter's Basilica is located in Vatican City, above the traditional site of Saint Peter's tomb , the papal cathedral for the Diocese of Rome is Saint John Lateran , located within the city of Rome, though enjoying extraterritorial privileges accredited to the Holy See.  The position of cardinal is a rank of honour bestowed by popes on certain clergy, such as leaders within the Roman Curia, bishops serving in major cities and distinguished theologians. For advice and assistance in governing, the pope may turn to the College of Cardinals . [37]  Following the death or resignation of a pope, [note 5] members of the College of Cardinals who are under age 80 act as electoral college , meeting in a papal conclave to elect a successor. [39] Although the conclave may elect any male Catholic as pope, since 1389 only cardinals have been elected. [40]  Canon law  Main article: Canon law of the Catholic Church  The canon law of the Catholic Church is the system of laws and legal principles made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities to regulate the church's external organisation and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics towards the church's mission. [41] In the Catholic Church, universal positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either immutable divine and natural law , or changeable circumstantial and merely positive law , derive formal authority and promulgation from the office of pope who, as Supreme Pontiff , possesses the totality of legislative, executive and judicial power in his person. [42] It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: [43] laws, courts, lawyers, judges, [43] a fully articulated legal code, [44] principles of legal interpretation [45] and coercive penalties that are limited to moral coercion. [46] [47]  Canon law concerns the Catholic Church's life and organisation and is distinct from civil law. In its own field it gives force to civil law only by specific enactment in matters such as the guardianship of minors. [48] Similarly, civil law may give force in its field to canon law, but only by specific enactment, as with regard to canonical marriages. [49] Currently, the 1983 Code of Canon Law is in effect primarily for the Latin Church. [50] The distinct 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches ( CCEO , after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches.

The Catholic Church continues these traditions, through constituent autonomous particular churches , also known as "churches sui iuris " ( Latin : "of one's own right "). The largest and most well known is the Latin Church , with more than 1 billion members worldwide. Relatively small in terms of adherents compared to the Latin Church, are the 23 self-governing Eastern Catholic Churches with a combined membership of 17.3 million as of 2010 [update] . [52] [53] [54] [55]  The Latin Church is governed by the pope and diocesan bishops directly appointed by him. The pope exercises a direct patriarchal role over the Latin Church, which is considered to form the original and still major part of Western Christianity , a heritage of certain beliefs and customs originating in Europe and northwestern Africa, some of which are inherited by many Christian denominations that trace their origins to the Protestant Reformation . [56]  The Eastern Catholic Churches follow the traditions and spirituality of Eastern Christianity and are Churches that have always remained in full communion with the Catholic Church or who have chosen to reenter full communion in the centuries following the East–West Schism and earlier divisions. These churches are communities of Catholic Christians whose forms of worship reflect distinct historical and cultural influences rather than differences in doctrine.  A church sui iuris is defined in the Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches as a "group of Christian faithful united by a hierarchy" that is recognised by the Pope in his capacity as the supreme authority on matters of doctrine within the church. [57] The term is an innovation of the CCEO to denote the relative autonomy of the Eastern Catholic Churches, [58] who remain in full communion with the Pope, but have governance structures and liturgical traditions separate from that of the Latin Church. [53] While the Latin Church's canons do not explicitly use the term, it is tacitly recognised as equivalent.  Some Eastern Catholic Churches are governed by a patriarch who is elected by the synod of the bishops of that church, [59] others are headed by a major archbishop , [60] others are under a metropolitan , [61] and others are organised as individual eparchies . [62] Each church has authority over the particulars of its internal organisation, liturgical rites , liturgical calendar and other aspects of its spirituality, subject only to the authority of the Pope. [63] The Roman Curia has a specific department, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches , to maintain relations with them. [64] The pope does not generally appoint bishops or clergy in the Eastern Catholic Churches, deferring to their internal governance structures, but may intervene if he feels it necessary.

As of 2008 [update] , the Catholic Church has 2,795 dioceses. [66] The bishops in a particular country are members of a national or regional episcopal conference. [67]  Dioceses are divided into parishes , each with one or more priests , deacons or lay ecclesial ministers . [68] Parishes are responsible for the day to day celebration of the sacraments and pastoral care of the laity. [69] As of 2016 [update] , there are 221,700 parishes worldwide. [70]  In the Latin Church, Catholic men may serve as deacons or priests by receiving sacramental ordination . Men and women may serve as extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion , as readers (lectors); or as altar servers . Historically, boys and men have only been permitted to serve as altar servers; however, since the 1990s, girls and women have also been permitted. [71] [note 6]  Ordained Catholics, as well as members of the laity , may enter into consecrated life either on an individual basis, as a hermit or consecrated virgin , or by joining an institute of consecrated life (a religious institute or a secular institute ) in which to take vows confirming their desire to follow the three evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience. [72] Examples of institutes of consecrated life are the Benedictines , the Carmelites , the Dominicans , the Franciscans , the Missionaries of Charity , the Legionaries of Christ and the Sisters of Mercy . [72]  "Religious institutes" is a modern term encompassing both " religious orders " and " religious congregations " which were once distinguished in canon law . [73] The terms "religious order" and "religious institute" tend to be used as synonyms colloquially.

[75] Catholics represent about half of all Christians. [76]  Geographic distribution of Catholics worldwide continues to shift, with 17% in Africa, 48% in the Americas, 11% Asia, 23% in Europe, and 1% in Oceania. [75]  Catholic ministers include ordained clergy, lay ecclesial ministers , missionaries, and catechists. Also as of the end of 2014, there were 465,595 ordained clergy, including 5,237 bishops, 415,792 presbyters (diocesan and religious), and 44,566 deacons (permanent). [75] Non-ordained ministers included 3,157,568 catechists, 367,679 lay missionaries, and 39,951 lay ecclesial ministers . [77]  Catholics who have committed to religious or consecrated life instead of marriage or single celibacy, as a state of life or relational vocation, include 54,559 male religious, 705,529 women religious. These are not ordained, nor generally considered ministers unless also engaged in one of the lay minister categories above. [75]  Doctrine  Main articles: Catholic theology and Catholic Bible  Catholic doctrine has developed over the centuries, reflecting direct teachings of early Christians, formal definitions of heretical and orthodox beliefs by ecumenical councils and in papal bulls , and theological debate by scholars. The Church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new theological issues and is protected infallibly from falling into doctrinal error when a firm decision on an issue is reached. [78] [79]  It teaches that revelation has one common source, God, and two distinct modes of transmission: Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition , [80] [81] and that these are authentically interpreted by the Magisterium. [82] [83] Sacred Scripture consists of the 73 books of the Catholic Bible , consisting of 46 Old Testament and 27 New Testament writings. Sacred Tradition consists of those teachings believed by the Church to have been handed down since the time of the Apostles. [84] Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition are collectively known as the "deposit of faith" ( depositum fidei ). These are in turn interpreted by the Magisterium (from magister , Latin for "teacher"), the Church's teaching authority, which is exercised by the pope and the College of Bishops in union with the pope, the bishop of Rome. [85] Catholic doctrine is authoritatively summarised in the Catechism of the Catholic Church , published by the Holy See. [86] [87]  Nature of God     C. 1210 manuscript version of the traditional Shield of the Trinity theological diagram    Main article: Trinity  The Catholic Church holds that there is one eternal God, who exists as a perichoresis ("mutual indwelling") of three hypostases , or "persons": God the Father ; God the Son ; and God the Holy Spirit , which together are called the " Holy Trinity ". [88]  Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is the "Second Person" of the Trinity, God the Son. In an event known as the Incarnation , through the power of the Holy Spirit, God became united with human nature through the conception of Christ in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary . Christ, therefore, is understood as being both fully divine and fully human, including possessing a human soul . It is taught that Christ's mission on earth included giving people his teachings and providing his example for them to follow as recorded in the four Gospels. [89] Jesus is believed to have remained sinless while on earth, and to have allowed himself to be unjustly executed by crucifixion , as sacrifice of himself to reconcile humanity to God; this reconciliation is known as the Paschal Mystery . [90] The Greek term "Christ" and the Hebrew "Messiah" both mean "anointed one", referring to the Christian belief that Jesus' death and resurrection are the fulfilment of the Old Testament's messianic prophecies . [91]  The Catholic Church teaches dogmatically that "the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son, not as from two principles but as from one single principle". [92] It holds that the Father, as the "principle without principle", is the first origin of the Spirit, but also that he, as Father of the only Son, is with the Son the single principle from which the Spirit proceeds. [93] This belief is expressed in the Filioque clause which was added to the Latin version of the Nicene Creed of 381 but not included in the Greek versions of the creed used in Eastern Christianity. [94]  Nature of the church     The Pentecost depicted in a 14th-century Missal    Main article: Catholic ecclesiology  The Catholic Church teaches that it is the " one true church ", [6] [95] "the universal sacrament of salvation for the human race", [96] [97] and "the one true religion". [98] According to the Catechism , the Catholic Church is further described in the Nicene Creed as the "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church". [99] These are collectively known as the Four Marks of the Church . The church teaches that its founder is Jesus Christ. [100] [101] The New Testament records several events considered integral to the establishment of the Catholic Church, including Jesus' activities and teaching and his appointment of the apostles as witnesses to his ministry, suffering, and resurrection. The Great Commission , after his resurrection, instructed the apostles to continue his work. The coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, in an event known as Pentecost , is seen as the beginning of the public ministry of the Catholic Church. [102] The church teaches that all duly consecrated bishops have a lineal succession from the apostles of Christ, known as apostolic succession . [103] In particular, the Bishop of Rome (the pope) is considered the successor to the apostle Simon Peter , a position from which he derives his supremacy over the Church. [104]  Catholic belief holds that the Church "is the continuing presence of Jesus on earth" [105] and that it alone possesses the full means of salvation . [106] Through the passion (suffering) of Christ leading to his crucifixion as described in the Gospels, it is said Christ made himself an oblation to God the Father in order to reconcile humanity to God; [107] the Resurrection of Jesus makes him the firstborn from the dead, the first among many brethren. [108] By reconciling with God and following Christ's words and deeds, an individual can enter the Kingdom of God . [109] The Church sees its liturgy and sacraments as perpetuating the graces achieved through Christ's sacrifice to strengthen a person's relationship with Christ and aid in overcoming sin. [110]  Final Judgment     Before his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ grants salvation to souls by the Harrowing of Hell . Fresco, by Fra Angelico , c. 1430s.    Main article: Last Judgment § Catholicism  The Catholic Church teaches that, immediately after death, the soul of each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins and their relationship to Christ. [111] [112] This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement , according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness. [113]  Depending on the judgement rendered following death, it is believed that a soul may enter one of three states of afterlife:   Heaven is a state of unending union with the divine nature of God, not ontologically, but by grace. It is an eternal life, in which the soul contemplates God in ceaseless beatitude . [114]  Purgatory is a temporary condition for the purification of souls who, although destined for Heaven, are not fully detached from sin and thus cannot enter Heaven immediately. [115] In Purgatory, the soul suffers, and is purged and perfected. Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the intercession of saints . [116]  Final Damnation : Finally, those who persist in living in a state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject themselves to hell, an everlasting separation from God. [117] The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. [118] No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. [119] Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. [120] Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo , although this is not an official dogma of the Church. [121]   While the Catholic Church teaches that it alone possesses the full means of salvation, [106] it also acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of Christian communities separated from itself to "impel towards Catholic unity" [122] and "tend and lead toward the Catholic Church", [122] and thus bring people to salvation, because these separated communities contain some elements of proper doctrine, albeit admixed with errors . It teaches that anyone who is saved is saved through the Catholic Church but that people can be saved outside of the ordinary means known as baptism of desire , and by pre-baptismal martyrdom, known as baptism of blood , as well as when conditions of invincible ignorance are present, although invincible ignorance in itself is not a means of salvation.

Main articles: Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church , Mariology of the Catholic Church , Mariology of the saints , Mariology of the popes , and Catholic devotions  Further information: Mary, mother of Jesus  Catholic Mariology deals with the doctrines and teachings concerning the life of the Mary, mother of Jesus , as well as the veneration of Mary by the faithful. Mary is held in special regard, declared the Mother of God ( Greek : Θεοτόκος , translit.  Theotokos , lit.  'God-bearer'), and believed as dogma to have remained a virgin throughout her life . [124] Further teachings include the doctrines of the Immaculate Conception (her own conception without the stain of original sin) and the Assumption of Mary (that her body was assumed directly into heaven at the end of her life). Both of these doctrines were defined as infallible dogma, by Pope Pius IX in 1854 and Pope Pius XII in 1950 respectively, [125] but only after consulting with the Catholic bishops throughout the world to ascertain that this is a Catholic belief. [126]  Devotions to Mary are part of Catholic piety but are distinct from the worship of God. [127] Practices include prayers and Marian art , music , and architecture . Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven . Pope Paul VI called her Mother of the Church because, by giving birth to Christ, she is considered to be the spiritual mother to each member of the Body of Christ . [125] Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions such as the Hail Mary , the Rosary , the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices. [128] Pilgrimages to the sites of several Marian apparitions affirmed by the Church, such as Lourdes , Fátima , and Guadalupe , [129] are also popular Catholic devotions. [130]  Devotions are "external practices of piety" which are not part of the official liturgy of the Catholic Church but are part of the popular spiritual practices of Catholics. [131] Outside of Mariology, other devotional practices include the Stations of the Cross , the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Face of Jesus , [132] the various scapulars , novenas to various saints, [133]  pilgrimages [134] and devotions to the Blessed Sacrament , [133] and the veneration of saintly images such as the santos . [135] The bishops at the Second Vatican Council reminded Catholics that "devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonise with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them." [136]  Sacraments      Seven Sacraments Altarpiece by Rogier van der Weyden , c. 1448       Mass at the Grotto at Lourdes , France . The chalice is displayed to the people immediately after the consecration of the wine.      Main article: Sacraments of the Catholic Church  The Catholic Church teaches that it was entrusted with seven sacraments that were instituted by Christ. The number and nature of the sacraments were defined by several ecumenical councils , most recently the Council of Trent. [137] [note 7] These are Baptism , Confirmation , the Eucharist , Penance , Anointing of the Sick (formerly called Extreme Unction, one of the " Last Rites "), Holy Orders and Holy Matrimony . Sacraments are visible rituals that Catholics see as signs of God's presence and effective channels of God's grace to all those who receive them with the proper disposition ( ex opere operato ). [138] The Catechism of the Catholic Church categorises the sacraments into three groups, the "sacraments of Christian initiation", "sacraments of healing" and "sacraments at the service of communion and the mission of the faithful". These groups broadly reflect the stages of people's natural and spiritual lives which each sacrament is intended to serve. [139]  The liturgies of the sacraments are central to the church's mission. According to the Catechism :   In the liturgy of the New Covenant every liturgical action, especially the celebration of the Eucharist and the sacraments, is an encounter between Christ and the Church. The liturgical assembly derives its unity from the "communion of the Holy Spirit" who gathers the children of God into the one Body of Christ. This assembly transcends racial, cultural, social – indeed, all human affinities. [140]   According to church doctrine, the sacraments of the church require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly celebrated. [141] In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. [142] Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ is present in the Eucharist, [143] those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). [144] Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating for at least an hour before receiving the sacrament. [144] Non-Catholics are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well. [142] [145]  Catholics, even if they were in danger of death and unable to approach a Catholic minister, may not ask for the sacraments of the Eucharist, penance or anointing of the sick from someone, such as a Protestant minister, who is not known to be validly ordained in line with Catholic teaching on ordination. [146] [147] Likewise, even in grave and pressing need, Catholic ministers may not administer these sacraments to those who do not manifest Catholic faith in the sacrament. In relation to the churches of Eastern Christianity not in communion with the Holy See, the Catholic Church is less restrictive, declaring that "a certain communion in sacris , and so in the Eucharist, given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not merely possible but is encouraged." [148]  Sacraments of Christian initiation  Main article: Sacraments of initiation  Baptism     Baptism of Augustine of Hippo as represented in a sculptural group in Troyes Cathedral (1549), France    As viewed by the Catholic Church, Baptism is the first of three sacraments of initiation as a Christian. [149] It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. [150] It makes a person a member of the Church. [151] As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit on the part of the person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children , [152] who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. [153] If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. [154] Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. [155] The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula . [156]  Confirmation  Main article: Confirmation in the Catholic Church  The Catholic Church sees the sacrament of confirmation as required to complete the grace given in baptism. [157] When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, [158] a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches . [159] In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they are old enough to understand or at the bishop's discretion. [160] In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism , the sacrament is called confirmation , because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation , because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism , [161] a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam , blessed by a bishop. [161] [162] Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by the sacrament of Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians. [163]  Eucharist      Pope Benedict XVI celebrates the Eucharist at the canonisation of Frei Galvão in São Paulo , Brazil on 11 May 2007    Main article: Eucharist in the Catholic Church  For Catholics, the Eucharist is the sacrament which completes Christian initiation. It is described as "the source and summit of the Christian life". [164] The ceremony in which a Catholic first receives the Eucharist is known as First Communion . [165]  The Eucharistic celebration, also called the Mass or Divine liturgy , includes prayers and scriptural readings, as well as an offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the altar and consecrated by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation . [166] [note 8] The words of consecration reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper , where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, [167] and perpetuates it. Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the sacrament of penance). [168]     A Catholic believer prays in a church in Mexico    Sacraments of healing  The two sacraments of healing are the Sacrament of Penance and Anointing of the Sick .  Penance  Main article: Sacrament of Penance  The Sacrament of Penance (also called Reconciliation, Forgiveness, Confession, and Conversion [169] ) exists for the conversion of those who, after baptism, separate themselves from Christ by sin. [170] Essential to this sacrament are acts both by the sinner (examination of conscience, contrition with a determination not to sin again, confession to a priest, and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin) and by the priest (determination of the act of reparation to be performed and absolution ). [171] Serious sins ( mortal sins ) should be confessed at least once a year and always before receiving Holy Communion, while confession of venial sins also is recommended. [172] The priest is bound under the severest penalties to maintain the " seal of confession ", absolute secrecy about any sins revealed to him in confession. [173]  Anointing of the sick     The Seven Sacraments Altarpiece  triptych painting of Extreme Unction (Anointing of the Sick) with oil being administered by a priest during last rites. Rogier van der Weyden , c. 1445.    Main article: Anointing of the Sick in the Catholic Church  While chrism is used only for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated, a different oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, has begun to be in danger of death. [174] This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins. [175]  The sacrament is also referred to as Unction , and in the past as Extreme Unction , and it is one of the three sacraments that constitute the last rites , together with Penance and Viaticum (Eucharist). [176]  Sacraments at the service of communion  According to the Catechism, there are two sacraments of communion directed towards the salvation of others: priesthood and marriage. [177] Within the general vocation to be a Christian, these two sacraments "consecrate to specific mission or vocation among the people of God. Men receive the holy orders to feed the Church by the word and grace . Spouses marry so that their love may be fortified to fulfill duties of their state". [178]  Holy Orders     Priests lay their hands on the ordinands during the rite of ordination.    Main article: Holy orders in the Catholic Church  The sacrament of Holy Orders consecrates and deputes some Christians to serve the whole body as members of three degrees or orders: episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests) and diaconate (deacons). [179] [180] The Church has defined rules on who may be ordained into the clergy . In the Latin Church, the priesthood is generally restricted to celibate men, and the episcopate is always restricted to celibate men. [181] Men who are already married may be ordained in certain Eastern Catholic churches in most countries, [182] and the personal ordinariates and may become deacons even in the Western Church [183] [184] (see Clerical marriage ). But after becoming a Catholic priest, a man may not marry (see Clerical celibacy ) unless he is formally laicised.  All clergy, whether deacons, priests or bishops, may preach, teach, baptise, witness marriages and conduct funeral liturgies. [185] Only bishops and priests can administer the sacraments of the Eucharist, Reconciliation (Penance) and Anointing of the Sick. [186] [187] Only bishops can administer the sacrament of Holy Orders, which ordains someone into the clergy. [188]  Matrimony     Wedding mass in the Philippines     Main article: Marriage in the Catholic Church  See also: Catholic teachings on sexual morality  The Catholic Church teaches that marriage is a social and spiritual bond between a man and a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality , it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. [189] [note 9] The Church recognises certain conditions , such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form , that Catholics must follow. [192]  The church does not recognise divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce only as a means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment . [193] Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid. [193]  Liturgy  Main article: Catholic liturgy     Catholic religious objects— Holy Bible , crucifix and rosary    Among the 24 autonomous ( sui iuris ) churches, numerous liturgical and other traditions exist, called rites, which reflect historical and cultural diversity rather than differences in belief. [194] In the definition of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches , "a rite is the liturgical, theological, spiritual, and disciplinary patrimony, culture and circumstances of history of a distinct people, by which its own manner of living the faith is manifested in each Church sui iuris ". [195]  The liturgy of the sacrament of the Eucharist , called the Mass in the West and Divine Liturgy or other names in the East, is the principal liturgy of the Catholic Church. [196] This is because it is considered the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ himself. [197] The most widely used is the Roman Rite , usually in its ordinary form promulgated by Paul VI in 1969, but also in its authorised extraordinary form , the Tridentine Mass as in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal . Eastern Catholic Churches have their own rites. The liturgies of the Eucharist and the other sacraments vary from rite to rite based on differing theological emphasis.

Concluding rites    " Ite, missa est !"     Catholicism portal       v  t  e       The Roman Rite is the most common rite of worship used by the Catholic Church. Its use is found worldwide, originating in Rome and spreading throughout Europe, influencing and eventually supplanting local rites. [198] The present ordinary form of Mass in the Roman Rite, found in the post-1969 editions of the Roman Missal , is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language, using an officially approved translation from the original text in Latin . An outline of its major liturgical elements can be found in the side bar.     Elevation of the chalice before an altar after the consecration during a Solemn Mass of Tridentine Mass    In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI affirmed the continued use of the 1962 Roman Missal as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite ("a Forma extraordinaria "), speaking of it also as an usus antiquior (older use), and issued new permissive norms for its employment. [199] An instruction issued four years later spoke of the two forms or usages of the Roman Rite approved by the pope as the ordinary form and the extraordinary form ("the forma ordinaria " and "the forma extraordinaria "). [200]  The 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, published a few months before the Second Vatican Council opened, was the last that presented the Mass as standardised in 1570 by Pope Pius V at the request of the Council of Trent and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass. [143] Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by Pope Clement VIII in 1604, Pope Urban VIII in 1634, Pope Pius X in 1911, Pope Pius XII in 1955, and Pope John XXIII in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops; [201] but Pope Benedict XVI 's 2007 motu proprio  Summorum Pontificum allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorised parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses. Except for the scriptural readings, which Pope Benedict allowed to be proclaimed in the vernacular language, it is celebrated exclusively in liturgical Latin . [202]  Since 2014, clergy in the small personal ordinariates set up for groups of former Anglicans under the terms of the 2009 document Anglicanorum Coetibus [203] are permitted to use a variation of the Roman Rite called "Divine Worship" or, less formally, "Ordinariate Use", [204] which incorporates elements of the Anglican liturgy and traditions. [note 10]  In the Archdiocese of Milan , with around five million Catholics the largest in Europe, [205] Mass is celebrated according to the Ambrosian Rite . Other Latin Church rites include the Mozarabic [206] and those of some religious institutes. [207] These liturgical rites have an antiquity of at least 200 years before 1570, the date of Pope Pius V's Quo primum , and were thus allowed to continue.

Main article: Catholic particular churches and liturgical rites § Eastern rites  The Eastern Catholic Churches share common patrimony and liturgical rites as their counterparts, including Eastern Orthodox and other Eastern Christian churches who are no longer in communion with the Holy See. These include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East. The Eastern Catholic Churches are groups of faithful who have either never been out of communion with the Holy See or who have restored communion with it at the cost of breaking communion with their associates of the same tradition. [209]  The rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches include the Byzantine Rite , in its Antiochian, Greek and Slavonic varieties; the Alexandrian Rite ; the Syriac Rite ; the Armenian Rite ; the Maronite Rite and the Chaldean Rite . Eastern Catholic Churches have the autonomy to set the particulars of their liturgical forms and worship, within certain limits to protect the "accurate observance" of their liturgical tradition. [210] In the past some of the rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches were subject to a degree of liturgical Latinisation . However, in recent years Eastern Catholic Churches have returned to traditional Eastern practices in accord with the Vatican II decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum . [211] Each church has its own liturgical calendar .

K. Chesterton          Catholicism portal       v  t  e       Catholic social teaching  Main article: Catholic social teaching  Catholic social teaching , reflecting the concern Jesus showed for the impoverished, places a heavy emphasis on the corporal works of mercy and the spiritual works of mercy , namely the support and concern for the sick, the poor and the afflicted. [213] [214] Church teaching calls for a preferential option for the poor while canon law prescribes that "The Christian faithful are also obliged to promote social justice and, mindful of the precept of the Lord, to assist the poor." [215] Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical letter Rerum novarum which upholds the rights and dignity of labor and the right of workers to form unions.  Catholic teaching regarding sexuality calls for a practice of chastity , with a focus on maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. [216] Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution .  The Church has also addressed stewardship of the natural environment, and its relationship to other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si' , dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development , and laments environmental degradation and global warming . [217] The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains. [218]  Social services  Main articles: Catholic Church and health care and Catholic education     Saint Teresa of Calcutta advocated for the sick, the poor and the needy by practising the acts of corporal works of mercy .    The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of education and medical services in the world. [16] In 2010, the Catholic Church's Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers said that the Church manages 26% of health care facilities in the world, including hospitals, clinics, orphanages, pharmacies and centres for those with leprosy. [219]  Religious institutes for women have played a particularly prominent role in the provision of health and education services, [220] as with orders such as the Sisters of Mercy , Little Sisters of the Poor , the Missionaries of Charity , the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart , the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament and the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul . [221] The Catholic nun Mother Teresa of Calcutta, India , founder of the Missionaries of Charity, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her humanitarian work among India's poor. [222] Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo won the same award in 1996 for "work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor". [223]  The Church is also actively engaged in international aid and development through organisations such as Catholic Relief Services , Caritas International , Aid to the Church in Need , refugee advocacy groups such as the Jesuit Refugee Service and community aid groups such as the Saint Vincent de Paul Society . [224]  Sexual morality   Main articles: Catholic theology of sexuality , Catholic theology of the body , and Marriage in the Catholic Church      Allegory of chastity by Hans Memling    The Catholic Church calls all members to practise chastity according to their state in life. Chastity includes temperance , self-mastery , personal and cultural growth, and divine grace . It requires refraining from lust , masturbation , fornication , pornography , prostitution and, especially, rape . Chastity for those who are not married requires living in continence , abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity. [225]  In the church's teaching, sexual activity is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians, or in a natural marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement to marriage , partners are called to practise continence, in order to test mutual respect and fidelity. [226] Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always be open to the possibility of life; [227] the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance. [228]  Contraception and certain other sexual practices are not permitted, although natural family planning methods are permitted to provide healthy spacing between births, or to postpone children for a just reason. [229]  Pope Francis said in 2015 that he is worried that the church has grown "obsessed" with issues such as abortion , same-sex marriage and contraception and has criticised the Catholic Church for placing dogma before love , and for prioritising moral doctrines over helping the poor and marginalised. [230] [231]  Divorce and declarations of nullity  Main article: Declaration of nullity  Further information: Divorce law by country  Canon law makes no provision for divorce between baptised individuals, as a valid, consummated sacramental marriage is considered to be a lifelong bond. [232] However, a declaration of nullity may be granted when proof is produced that essential conditions for contracting a valid marriage were absent from the beginning—in other words, that the marriage was not valid due to some impediment. A declaration of nullity, commonly called an annulment, is a judgement on the part of an ecclesiastical tribunal determining that a marriage was invalidly attempted. [233] In addition, marriages among unbaptised individuals may be dissolved with papal permission under certain situations, such as a desire to marry a Catholic, under Pauline or Petrine privilege . [190] [191] An attempt at remarriage following divorce without a declaration of nullity places "the remarried spouse […] in a situation of public and permanent adultery". An innocent spouse who lives in continence following divorce, or couples who live in continence following a civil divorce for a grave cause, do not sin. [234]  Worldwide, diocesan tribunals completed over 49000 cases for nullity of marriage in 2006. Over the past 30 years about 55 to 70% of annulments have occurred in the United States. The growth in annulments has been substantial; in the United States, 27,000 marriages were annulled in 2006, compared to 338 in 1968. However, approximately 200,000 married Catholics in the United States divorce each year; 10 million total as of 2006 [update] . [235] [note 11] Divorce is increasing in some predominantly Catholic countries in Europe. [237] In some predominantly Catholic countries, it is only in recent years that divorce was introduced (i.e. Italy (1970), Portugal (1975), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981), Ireland (1996), Chile (2004) and Malta (2011), while the Philippines and the Vatican City have no procedure for divorce. (The Philippines does, however, allow divorce for Muslims.)  Contraception    Main article: Christian views on contraception § Catholic Church  See also: Catholic Church and HIV/AIDS and Religious response to assisted reproductive technology § Catholicism      Pope Paul VI issued Humanae vitae on 25 July 1968.    The church teaches that sexual intercourse should only take place between a married man and woman, and should be without the use of birth control or contraception . In his encyclical Humanae vitae [238] (1968), Pope Paul VI firmly rejected all contraception, thus contradicting dissenters in the Church that saw the birth control pill as an ethically justifiable method of contraception, though he permitted the regulation of births by means of natural family planning . This teaching was continued especially by John Paul II in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae , where he clarified the Church's position on contraception, abortion and euthanasia by condemning them as part of a "culture of death" and calling instead for a " culture of life ". [239]  Many Western Catholics have voiced significant disagreement with the Church's teaching on contraception. [240]  Catholics for Choice , a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives at some point in their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. [241] Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. [note 12] As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use. [244]  Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes in vitro fertilisation (IVF), saying that the artificial process replaces the love between a husband and wife. [245] In addition, it opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul who must be treated as such. [246] For this reason, the church also opposes abortion . [247]  Homosexuality  Main article: Homosexuality and the Catholic Church  The Catholic Church also teaches that "homosexual acts" are "contrary to the natural law", "acts of grave depravity" and "under no circumstances can they be approved", but that persons experiencing homosexual tendencies must be accorded respect and dignity. [248] According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church ,   The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided….  Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection. [249]   This part of the Catechism was quoted by Pope Francis in a 2013 press interview in which he remarked, when asked about an individual:   I think that when you encounter a person like this [the individual he was asked about], you must make a distinction between the fact of a person being gay from the fact of being a lobby, because lobbies, all are not good. That is bad. If a person is gay and seeks the Lord and has good will, well who am I to judge them? [250]   This remark and others made in the same interview were seen as a change in the tone, but not in the substance of the teaching of the Church, [251] which includes opposition to same-sex marriage . [252] Certain dissenting Catholic groups oppose the position of the Catholic Church and seek to change it. [253]  Holy orders and women   Main articles: Ordination of women in the Catholic Church and Women in the Catholic Church  Women and men religious engage in a variety of occupations, from contemplative prayer, to teaching, to providing health care, to working as missionaries. [220] [254] While Holy Orders are reserved for men, Catholic women have played diverse roles in the life of the church, with religious institutes providing a formal space for their participation and convents providing spaces for their self-government, prayer and influence through many centuries. Religious sisters and nuns have been extensively involved in developing and running the Church's worldwide health and education service networks. [255]  Efforts in support of the ordination of women to the priesthood led to several rulings by the Roman Curia or Popes against the proposal, as in Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood (1976), Mulieris Dignitatem (1988) and Ordinatio Sacerdotalis (1994). According to the latest ruling, found in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis , Pope John Paul II affirmed that the Catholic Church "does not consider herself authorized to admit women to priestly ordination." [256] In defiance of these rulings, opposition groups such as Roman Catholic Womenpriests have performed ceremonies they affirm as sacramental ordinations (with, reputedly, an ordaining male Catholic bishop in the first few instances) which, according to canon law , are both illicit and invalid and considered mere simulations [257] of the sacrament of ordination. [258] [note 13] The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith responded by issuing a statement clarifying that any Catholic bishops involved in ordination ceremonies for women, as well as the women themselves if they were Catholic, would automatically receive the penalty of excommunication ( latae sententiae , literally "with the sentence already applied", i.e. automatically), citing canon 1378 of canon law and other church laws. [259]  Sexual abuse cases  Main article: Catholic Church sexual abuse cases  From the 1990s, the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy and other church members has become the subject of civil litigation, criminal prosecution, media coverage and public debate in countries around the world . The Catholic Church has been criticised for its handling of abuse complaints when it became known that some bishops had shielded accused priests, transferring them to other pastoral assignments where some continued to commit sexual offences.  In response to the scandal, formal procedures have been established to help prevent abuse, encourage the reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly, although groups representing victims have disputed their effectiveness. [260] In 2014, Pope Francis instituted the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors for the safeguarding of minors. [261]  History  Main article: History of the Catholic Church  Further information: History of early Christianity and Historiography of early Christianity     This fresco (1481–82) by Pietro Perugino in the Sistine Chapel shows Jesus giving the keys of heaven to Saint Peter .        The Last Supper , a late 1490s mural painting by Leonardo da Vinci , depicting the last supper of Jesus and his twelve apostles on the eve of his crucifixion . Most apostles are buried in Rome , including Saint Peter.    The Christian religion is based on the teachings of Jesus Christ , who lived and preached in the 1st century AD in the province of Judea of the Roman Empire . Catholic doctrine teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established by Jesus. [6] Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. Emperor Constantine legalised the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, many of whom had previously adopted Arian Christianity , eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries.  In the 7th and 8th centuries, expanding Muslim conquests following the advent of Islam led to an Arab domination of the Mediterranean that severed political connections between that area and northern Europe, and weakened cultural connections between Rome and the Byzantine Empire . Conflicts involving authority in the church, particularly the authority of the Bishop of Rome finally culminated in the East–West Schism in the 11th century, splitting the Church into the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Earlier splits within the Church occurred after the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Chalcedon (451). However, a few Eastern Churches remained in communion with Rome, and portions of some others established communion in the 15th century and later, forming what are called the Eastern Catholic Churches .  Early monasteries throughout Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman classical civilisation . The Church eventually became the dominant influence in Western civilisation into the modern age. Many Renaissance figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the Church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the Protestant Reformation , as well as in the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment . Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the Church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.  In 1870, the First Vatican Council declared the dogma of papal infallibility and the Kingdom of Italy annexed the city of Rome, the last portion of the Papal States to be incorporated into the new nation. In the 20th century, anti-clerical governments around the world, including Mexico and Spain, persecuted or executed thousands of clerics and laypersons. In the Second World War, the Church condemned Nazism, and protected hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Holocaust ; its efforts, however, have been criticised as inadequate. After the war, freedom of religion was severely restricted in the Communist countries newly aligned with the Soviet Union , several of which had large Catholic populations.  In the 1960s, the Second Vatican Council led to reforms of the Church's liturgy and practices, described as "opening the windows" by defenders, but criticised by traditionalist Catholics . In the face of increased criticism from both within and without, the Church has upheld or reaffirmed at various times controversial doctrinal positions regarding sexuality and gender, including limiting clergy to males, and moral exhortations against abortion , contraception , sexual activity outside of marriage, remarriage following divorce without annulment , and against same-sex marriage .  Apostolic era and papacy  Main article: Apostolic Age     Jesus' commission to Saint Peter    The New Testament , in particular the Gospels , records Jesus' activities and teaching, his appointment of the twelve Apostles and his Great Commission of the Apostles, instructing them to continue his work. [101] [262] The book Acts of Apostles , tells of the founding of the Christian church and the spread of its message to the Roman empire. [263] The Catholic Church teaches that its public ministry began on Pentecost , occurring fifty days following the date Christ is believed to have resurrected . [102] At Pentecost, the Apostles are believed to have received the Holy Spirit, preparing them for their mission in leading the church. [264] [265] The Catholic Church teaches that the college of bishops , led by the Bishop of Rome are the successors to the Apostles. [266]  In the account of the Confession of Peter found in the Gospel of Matthew , Christ designates Peter as the "rock" upon which Christ's church will be built. [267] [268] The Catholic Church considers the Bishop of Rome, the pope, to be the successor to Saint Peter. [269] Some scholars state Peter was the first Bishop of Rome. [270] [note 14] Others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome. [271] Many scholars hold that a church structure of plural presbyters/bishops persisted in Rome until the mid-2nd century, when the structure of a single bishop and plural presbyters was adopted, [272] and that later writers retrospectively applied the term "bishop of Rome" to the most prominent members of the clergy in the earlier period and also to Peter himself. [272] On this basis, Oscar Cullmann , [273]  Henry Chadwick , [274] and Bart D. Ehrman [275] question whether there was a formal link between Peter and the modern papacy. Raymond E. Brown also says that it is anachronistic to speak of Peter in terms of local bishop of Rome, but that Christians of that period would have looked on Peter as having "roles that would contribute in an essential way to the development of the role of the papacy in the subsequent church". These roles, Brown says, "contributed enormously to seeing the bishop of Rome, the bishop of the city where Peter died, and where Paul witnessed to the truth of Christ, as the successor of Peter in care for the church universal". [272]  Antiquity and Roman Empire  Main articles: Early centers of Christianity , Pentarchy , and List of Christian heresies       Part of a series on    Ecumenical councils of the Catholic Church     Renaissance depiction of the Council of Trent     Antiquity ( c. 50 – 451)      Jerusalem  Nicaea I  Constantinople I  Ephesus  Chalcedon      Early Middle Ages (553–870)      Constantinople II  Constantinople III  Nicaea II  Constantinople IV      High and Late Middle Ages (1122–1517)      Lateran I  Lateran II  Lateran III  Lateran IV  Lyon I  Lyon II  Vienne  Constance  Florence  Lateran V      Modernity (1545–1965)      Trent  Vatican I  Vatican II       Catholicism portal       v  t  e       Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's network of roads and waterways facilitated travel, and the Pax Romana made travelling safe. The empire encouraged the spread of a common culture with Greek roots, which allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood. [276]  Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see Idolatry ). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century. [277]     19th century drawing of Old Saint Peter's Basilica , originally built in 318 by Emperor Constantine    In 313, Emperor Constantine I 's Edict of Milan legalised Christianity, and in 330 Constantine moved the imperial capital to Constantinople , modern Istanbul, Turkey . In 380 the Edict of Thessalonica made Nicene Christianity the state church of the Roman Empire , a position that within the diminishing territory of the Byzantine Empire would persist until the empire itself ended in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, while elsewhere the church was independent of the empire, as became particularly clear with the East–West Schism . During the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils , five primary sees emerged, an arrangement formalised in the mid-6th century by Emperor Justinian I as the pentarchy of Rome, Constantinople , Antioch , Jerusalem and Alexandria . [278] [279] In 451 the Council of Chalcedon , in a canon of disputed validity, [280] elevated the see of Constantinople to a position "second in eminence and power to the bishop of Rome". [281] From c. 350 to c. 500, the bishops, or popes, of Rome, steadily increased in authority through their consistent intervening in support of orthodox leaders in theological disputes, which encouraged appeals to them. [282] Emperor Justinian , who in the areas under his control definitively established a form of caesaropapism , [283] in which "he had the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest details of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church", [284] reestablished imperial power over Rome and other parts of the West, initiating the period termed the Byzantine Papacy (537–752), during which the bishops of Rome, or popes, required approval from the emperor in Constantinople or from his representative in Ravenna for consecration, and most were selected by the emperor from his Greek-speaking subjects, [285] resulting in a "melting pot" of Western and Eastern Christian traditions in art as well as liturgy. [286]  Most of the Germanic tribes who in the following centuries invaded the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity in its Arian form, which the Catholic Church declared heretical . [287] The resulting religious discord between Germanic rulers and Catholic subjects [288] was avoided when, in 497, Clovis I , the Frankish ruler, converted to orthodox Catholicism, allying himself with the papacy and the monasteries. [289] The Visigoths in Spain followed his lead in 589, [290] and the Lombards in Italy in the course of the 7th century. [291]  Western Christianity , particularly through its monasteries , was a major factor in preserving classical civilisation , with its art (see Illuminated manuscript ) and literacy. [292] [293] Through his Rule , Benedict of Nursia (c.480–543), one of the founders of Western monasticism , exerted an enormous influence on European culture through the appropriation of the monastic spiritual heritage of the early Church and, with the spread of the Benedictine tradition, through the preservation and transmission of ancient culture. During this period, monastic Ireland became a centre of learning and early Irish missionaries such as St Columbanus and St Columba spread Christianity and established monasteries across continental Europe. [1]  The massive Islamic invasions of the mid-7th century began a long struggle between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The Byzantine Empire soon lost the lands of the eastern patriarchates of Jerusalem , Alexandria and Antioch and was reduced to that of Constantinople , the empire's capital. As a result of Islamic domination of the Mediterranean , the Frankish state, centred away from that sea, was able to evolve as the dominant power that shaped the Western Europe of the Middle Ages. [294] The battles of Toulouse and Poitiers halted the Islamic advance in the West and the failed Siege of Constantinople halted it in the East. Two or three decades later, in 751, the Byzantine Empire lost to the Lombards the city of Ravenna from which it governed the small fragments of Italy, including Rome, that acknowledged its sovereignty. The fall of Ravenna meant that confirmation by a no longer existent exarch was not asked for during the election in 752 of Pope Stephen II and that the papacy was forced to look elsewhere for a civil power to protect it. [295] In 754, at the urgent request of Pope Stephen, the Frankish king Pepin the Short conquered the Lombards. He then gifted the lands of the former exarchate to the pope, thus initiating the Papal States . Rome and the Byzantine East would delve into further conflict during the Photian schism of the 860s, when Photius criticised the Latin west of adding of the filioque clause after being excommunicated by Nicholas I . Though the schism was reconciled, unresolved issues would lead to further division.

[5] It was the primary sponsor of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque styles in art, architecture and music. [297] Renaissance figures such as Raphael , Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci , Botticelli , Fra Angelico , Tintoretto , Titian , Bernini and Caravaggio are examples of the numerous visual artists sponsored by the Church. [298]  In the 11th century, the efforts of Hildebrand of Sovana led to the creation of the College of Cardinals to elect new popes, starting with Pope Alexander II in the papal election of 1061 . When Alexander II died, Hildebrand was elected to succeed him, as Pope Gregory VII . The basic election system of the College of Cardinals which Gregory VII helped establish has continued to function into the 21st century. Pope Gregory VII further initiated the Gregorian Reforms regarding the independence of the clergy from secular authority. This led to the Investiture Controversy between the church and the Holy Roman Emperors , over which had the authority to appoint bishops and popes. [299] [300]  In 1095, Byzantine emperor Alexius I appealed to Pope Urban II for help against renewed Muslim invasions in the Byzantine–Seljuk Wars , [301] which caused Urban to launch the First Crusade aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and returning the Holy Land to Christian control. [302] In the 11th century , strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the Latin Church separated them in the East–West Schism , partially due to conflicts over papal authority . The Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach. [303] In this age great gothic cathedrals in France were an expression of popular pride in the Christian faith.  In the early 13th century mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán . The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played a large role in the transformation of Church sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, such as that of Charlemagne at Aachen , into the prominent universities of Europe. [304]  Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' Summa Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation. [305]  A growing sense of church-state conflicts marked the 14th century. To escape instability in Rome, Clement V in 1309 became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of Avignon in southern France [306] during a period known as the Avignon Papacy . The Avignon Papacy ended in 1376 when the pope returned to Rome, [307] but was followed in 1378 by the 38-year-long Western schism with claimants to the papacy in Rome, Avignon and (after 1409) Pisa. [307] The matter was finally resolved in 1417 at the Council of Constance where the cardinals called upon all three claimants to the papal throne to resign, and held a new election naming Martin V pope. [308]     The Renaissance period was a golden age for Catholic art . Pictured: the Sistine Chapel ceiling painted by Michelangelo .    In 1438, the Council of Florence convened, which featured a strong dialogue focussed on understanding the theological differences between the East and West, with the hope of reuniting the Catholic and Orthodox churches. [309] Several eastern churches reunited, forming the Eastern Catholic Churches . [310]  Age of discovery  Main article: Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery  The Age of Discovery beginning in the 15th century saw the expansion of Western Europe's political and cultural influence worldwide. Because of the prominent role the strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal played in Western Colonialism, Catholicism was spread to the Americas, Asia and Oceania by explorers, conquistadors, and missionaries, as well as by the transformation of societies through the socio-political mechanisms of colonial rule. Pope Alexander VI had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal [311] and the ensuing patronato system allowed state authorities, not the Vatican, to control all clerical appointments in the new colonies. [312] In 1521 the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan made the first Catholic converts in the Philippines. [313] Elsewhere, Portuguese missionaries under the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelised in India, China, and Japan. [314]  Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation  Main articles: Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation      Martin Luther , originally an Augustinian friar, initiated the Protestant Reformation against the Catholic Church in 1517.    In 1517, Martin Luther , an Augustinian friar in Germany, sent his Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. [315] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [315] [316] In Switzerland , Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the Protestant Reformation , which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism . [317] The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for a declaration of nullity of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon , he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of the Church of England , which would in time lead to the development of Anglicanism . [318]  The Reformation led to clashes between the Protestant Schmalkaldic League and the Catholic Emperor Charles V and his allies. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 with the Peace of Augsburg but continued tensions produced a far graver conflict—the Thirty Years' War —which broke out in 1618. [319] In France, a series of conflicts termed the French Wars of Religion was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the Huguenots (French Calvinists ) and the forces of the French Catholic League . A series of popes sided with and became financial supporters of the Catholic League. [320] This ended under Pope Clement VIII , who hesitantly accepted King Henry IV's 1598 Edict of Nantes , which granted civil and religious toleration to French Protestants. [319] [320]  The Council of Trent (1545–1563) became the driving force behind the Counter-Reformation in response to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as transubstantiation and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. [321] In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world, in part through missionaries and imperialism , although its hold on European populations declined due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment .

[323] In the 18th century, writers such as Voltaire and the Encyclopédistes wrote biting critiques of both religion and the Catholic Church. One target of their criticism was the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV of France , which ended a century-long policy of religious toleration of Protestant Huguenots. The French Revolution of 1789 brought about a shifting of powers from the Church to the State, destruction of churches, and the establishment of a Cult of Reason . [324] In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte 's General Louis-Alexandre Berthier invaded the Italian Peninsula , imprisoning Pope Pius VI , who died in captivity. Napoleon later re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801 . [325] The end of the Napoleonic Wars brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States . [326]  In 1854, Pope Pius IX , with the support of the overwhelming majority of Catholic bishops, whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853, proclaimed the Immaculate Conception as a Dogma in the Catholic Church . [327] In 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements. [328] [329] Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church . [330]  The Italian unification of the 1860s incorporated the Papal States, including Rome itself from 1870, into the Kingdom of Italy , thus ending the papacy's millennial temporal power . Pope Pius IX rejected the Italian Law of Guarantees , which granted him special privileges, and to avoid placing himself in visible subjection to the Italian authorities remained a " prisoner in the Vatican ". [331] This stand-off, which was spoken of as the Roman Question , was resolved by the 1929 Lateran Treaties , whereby the Holy See acknowledged Italian sovereignty over the former Papal States and Italy recognised papal sovereignty over Vatican City as a new sovereign and independent state. [332]  20th century     Members of the Canadian Royal 22 e Regiment in audience with Pope Pius XII , following the Liberation of Rome in 1944 during World War II    Main article: Catholic Church in the 20th century  A number of anti-clerical governments emerged in the 20th century.  The 1926 Calles Law separating church and state in Mexico led to the Cristero War [333] in which more than 3,000 priests were exiled or assassinated, [334] churches desecrated, services mocked, nuns raped, and captured priests shot. [333] Following the 1917 October Revolution , persecution of the Church and Catholics in the Soviet Union continued into the 1930s, with the execution and exiling of clerics, monks and laymen, the confiscation of religious implements, and closure of churches. [335] [336] In the 1936–39 Spanish Civil War , the Catholic hierarchy allied with Franco's  Nationalists against the Popular Front government, [337] citing as justification Republican violence against the Church. [338] [339]  Pope Pius XI referred to these three countries as a "terrible triangle". [340] [341]  After violations of the 1933 Reichskonkordat between the Church and Nazi Germany , Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge , which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the Church and their ideology of neo-paganism and racial superiority . [342] [343] [344] The Church condemned the 1939 Invasion of Poland that started World War II and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions. [345] Thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries occupied by the Nazis, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein . [346] While Pope Pius XII has been credited with helping to save hundreds of thousands of Jews during the Holocaust , [347] [348] the Church has also been accused of having encouraged centuries of antisemitism by its teachings [349] and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities. [350]  During the post-war period, Communist governments in Eastern Europe severely restricted religious freedoms. [351] Although some priests and religious people collaborated with Communist regimes, [352] many others were imprisoned, deported, or executed. The Church was an important player in the fall of Communism in Europe, particularly in the Polish People's Republic . [353]  In 1949, the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries. [354] The new government also created the Patriotic Church and appointed its bishops. These appointments were initially rejected by Rome, before many of them were accepted. [355] In the 1960s during the Cultural Revolution , the Chinese Communists closed all religious establishments. When Chinese churches eventually reopened, they remained under the control of the Patriotic Church. Many Catholic pastors and priests continued to be sent to prison for refusing to renounce allegiance to Rome. [356]  Second Vatican Council     Bishops listen during the Second Vatican Council    Main articles: Second Vatican Council , History of the Catholic Church since 1962 , and Spirit of Vatican II  See also: Christian views on contraception § Catholic Church  The Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent , four centuries before. [357] Initiated by Pope John XXIII , this ecumenical council modernised the practices of the Catholic Church, allowing the Mass to be said in the vernacular (local language) and encouraging "fully conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations". [358] It intended to engage the Church more closely with the present world ( aggiornamento ), which was described by its advocates as an "opening of the windows". [359] In addition to changes in the liturgy, it led to changes to the Church's approach to ecumenism , [360] and a call to improved relations with non-Christian religions, especially Judaism , in its document Nostra aetate . [361]  The council, however, generated significant controversy in implementing its reforms: proponents of the " Spirit of Vatican II " such as Swiss theologian Hans Küng said that Vatican II had "not gone far enough" to change church policies. [362]  Traditionalist Catholics , such as Archbishop  Marcel Lefebvre , however, strongly criticised the council, arguing that its liturgical reforms led "to the destruction of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the sacraments", among other issues. [363]  Several teachings of the Catholic Church came under increased scrutiny both concurrent with and following the council; among those teachings was the church's teaching regarding the immorality of contraception . The recent introduction of hormonal contraception (including "the pill"), which were believed by some to be morally different than previous methods, prompted John XXIII to form a committee to advise him of the moral and theological issues with the new method. [364] [365]  Pope Paul VI later expanded the committee's scope to freely examine all methods, and the committee's unreleased final report was rumoured to suggest permitting at least some methods of contraception. Paul did not agree with the arguments presented, and eventually issued Humanae vitae , saying that it upheld the constant teaching of the church against contraception. It expressly included hormonal methods as prohibited. [note 15] This document generated a largely negative response from many Catholics. [ from whom? ] [366]  John Paul II      Pope John Paul II was credited as a major influence to the end of the Cold War and the fall of communism . Here with U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy , in 1982.    Main article: Pope John Paul II  In 1978, Pope John Paul II , formerly Archbishop of Kraków in the Polish People's Republic , became the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. His 27-year pontificate was one of the longest in history. [367]  Mikhail Gorbachev , the president of the Soviet Union , credited the Polish pope with hastening the fall of Communism in Europe. [368]  John Paul sought to evangelise an increasingly secular world . He instituted World Youth Day as a "worldwide encounter with the pope" for young people; it is now held every two to three years. [369] He travelled more than any other pope, visiting 129 countries, [370] and used television and radio as means of spreading the Church's teachings. He also emphasised the dignity of work and natural rights of labourers to have fair wages and safe conditions in Laborem exercens . [371] He emphasised several church teachings, including moral exhortations against abortion , euthanasia , and against widespread use of the death penalty , in Evangelium Vitae . [372]  From the late 20th century, the Catholic Church has been criticised for its doctrines on sexuality , its refusal to ordain women , and its handling of sexual abuse cases .  21st century      Pope Benedict XVI , who strengthened the relationship between the Catholic Church and art , has been called "the pope of aesthetics ".    In 2005, following the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI , head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularisation , [373] and for liberalising use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962. [374] In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world . [375] Benedict resigned in 2013 due to the frailties of advanced age, the first pope to do so in nearly 600 years. [376]  Pope Francis      Pope Francis , noted for his ecumencial efforts, meeting Patriarch Bartholomew I of the Eastern Orthodox Church at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , Jerusalem , during pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 2014    Main article: Pope Francis  Pope Francis , the current pope of the Catholic Church, succeeded Pope Benedict XVI in 2013 as the first pope from the Americas , the first from the Southern Hemisphere , and the first Pope from outside Europe since the Syrian Gregory III , who reigned in the 8th century. Pope Francis has been noted for his humility , emphasis on God's mercy, concern for the poor and the environment , as well as his commitment to interfaith dialogue . He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors.  Pope Francis is recognised for his efforts "to further close the nearly 1,000-year estrangement with the Orthodox Churches ". [377] Pope Francis' installation was attended by Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople of the Eastern Orthodox Church , [378] the first time since the Great Schism of 1054 that the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has attended a papal installation. [379] On 12 February 2016, Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill of Moscow , head of the largest Eastern Orthodox church, met in Havana , Cuba , issuing the a joint declaration calling for restored Christian unity between the two churches. This was reported as the first such high-level meeting between the two churches since the Great Schism of 1054. [380]  In 2014, the Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops addressed the church's ministry towards families and marriages and to Catholics in "irregular" relationships, such as those who divorced and remarried outside of the church without a declaration of nullity . [381] [382] While welcomed by some, it was criticised by some for perceived ambiguity, provoking controversies among individual representatives of differing perspectives. [383]  In 2017 during a visit in Egypt , Pope Francis reestablished mutual recognition of baptism with the Coptic Orthodox Church .

Regarding Peter as the first Bishop of Rome, "It is not, however, difficult to show that the fact of his [Peter's] bishopric is so well attested as to be historically certain. In considering this point, it will be well to begin with the third century, when references to it become frequent, and work backwards from this point. In the middle of the third century St. Cyprian expressly terms the Roman See the Chair of St. Peter, saying that Cornelius has succeeded to "the place of Fabian which is the place of Peter" (Ep 55:8; cf. 59:14). Firmilian of Caesarea notices that Stephen claimed to decide the controversy regarding rebaptism on the ground that he held the succession from Peter (Cyprian, Ep. 75:17). He does not deny the claim: yet certainly, had he been able, he would have done so. Thus in 250 the Roman episcopate of Peter was admitted by those best able to know the truth, not merely at Rome but in the churches of Africa and of Asia Minor. In the first quarter of the century (about 220) Tertullian (De Pud. 21) mentions Callistus's claim that Peter's power to forgive sins had descended in a special manner to him. Had the Roman Church been merely founded by Peter and not reckoned him as its first bishop, there could have been no ground for such a contention. Tertullian, like Firmilian, had every motive to deny the claim. Moreover, he had himself resided at Rome, and would have been well aware if the idea of a Roman episcopate of Peter had been, as is contended by its opponents, a novelty dating from the first years of the third century, supplanting the older tradition according to which Peter and Paul were co-founders, and Linus first bishop. About the same period, Hippolytus (for Lightfoot is surely right in holding him to be the author of the first part of the "Liberian Catalogue" — "Clement of Rome", 1:259) reckons Peter in the list of Roman bishops...."

It is possible, according to Catholic doctrine, to affirm correctly that the Church of Christ is present and operative in the churches and ecclesial Communities not yet fully in communion with the Catholic Church, on account of the elements of sanctification and truth that are present in them.   ^  "Declaration on the Unicity and Salvific Universality of Jesus Christ and the Church Dominus Iesus § 17". Vatican.va. Therefore, there exists a single Church of Christ, which subsists in the Catholic Church, governed by the Successor of Peter and by the Bishops in communion with him. The Churches which, while not existing in perfect Koinonia with the Catholic Church, remain united to her by means of the closest bonds, that is, by apostolic succession and a valid Eucharist, are true particular Churches . Therefore, the Church of Christ is present and operative also in these Churches, even though they lack full communion with the Catholic Church, since they do not accept the Catholic doctrine of the Primacy, which, according to the will of God, the Bishop of Rome objectively has and exercises over the entire Church. … 'The Christian faithful are therefore not permitted to imagine that the Church of Christ is nothing more than a collection—divided, yet in some way one—of Churches and ecclesial communities; nor are they free to hold that today the Church of Christ nowhere really exists, and must be considered only as a goal which all Churches and ecclesial communities must strive to reach.'

Excerpt: "After the separation of East and West 'Catholic' was assumed as its descriptive epithet by the Western or Latin Church, as 'Orthodox' was by the Eastern or Greek. At the Reformation the term 'Catholic' was claimed as its exclusive right by the body remaining under the Roman obedience, in opposition to the 'Protestant' or 'Reformed' National Churches. These, however, also retained the term, giving it, for the most part, a wider and more ideal or absolute sense, as the attribute of no single community, but only of the whole communion of the saved and saintly in all churches and ages. In England, it was claimed that the Church, even as Reformed, was the national branch of the 'Catholic Church' in its proper historical sense."

County Armagh (named after its county town, Armagh ) is one of six counties that form Northern Ireland . Adjoined to the southern shore of Lough Neagh , the county covers an area of 1,326 km² [4] and has a population of about 174,792. County Armagh is known as the "Orchard County" because of its many apple orchards. [5] It is also one of the thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland , as well as part of the historic province of Ulster .

Macha is mentioned in The Book of the Taking of Ireland , and is also said to have been responsible for the construction of the hill site of Emain Macha (now Navan Fort near Armagh City ) to serve as the capital of the Ulaid kings (who give their name to Ulster ), also thought to be Macha 's height .  Geography and features  From its highest point at Slieve Gullion , in the south of the County, Armagh's land falls away from its rugged south with Carrigatuke, Lislea and Camlough mountains, to rolling drumlin country in the middle and west of the county and finally flatlands in the north where rolling flats and small hills reach sea level at Lough Neagh .     An orchard near Drummannon    County Armagh's boundary with Louth is marked by the rugged Ring of Gullion rising in the south of the county whilst much of its boundary with Monaghan and Down goes unnoticed with seamless continuance of drumlins and small lakes. The River Blackwater marks the border with County Tyrone and Lough Neagh otherwise marks out the County's northern boundary.  There are also a number of uninhabited islands in the county's section of Lough Neagh: Coney Island Flat, Croaghan Flat, Padian, Phil Roe's Flat and the Shallow Flat.  Climate  Despite lying in the east of Ireland, Armagh enjoys an oceanic climate strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream with damp mild winters, and temperate, wet summers. Overall temperatures rarely drop below freezing during daylight hours, though frost is not infrequent in the months November to February. Snow rarely lies for longer than a few hours even in the elevated south-east of the County. Summers are mild and wet and although with sunshine often interspersed with showers, daylight lasts for almost 18 hours during high-summer.

It was ruled by the Red Branch , whose capital was Emain Macha (or Navan Fort) near Armagh. The site, and subsequently the city, were named after the goddess  Macha . The Red Branch play an important role in the Ulster Cycle , as well as the Cattle Raid of Cooley . However, they were eventually driven out of the area by the Three Collas, who invaded in the 4th century and held power until the 12th. The Clan Colla ruled the area known as Airghialla or Oriel for these 800 years.  The chief Irish septs of the county were descendants of the Collas, the O'Hanlons and MacCanns, and the Uí Néill , the O'Neills of Fews. Armagh was divided into several baronies: Armagh was held by the O'Rogans, Lower Fews was held by O'Neill of the Fews, and Upper Fews were under governance of the O'Larkins, who were later displaced by the MacCanns. Oneilland East was the territory of the O'Garveys, who were also displaced by the MacCanns. Oneilland West, like Oneilland East, was once O'Neill territory, until it was then held by the MacCanns, who were Lords of Clanbrassil. Upper and Lower Orior were O'Hanlon territory. Tiranny was ruled by Ronaghan. Miscellaneous tracts of land were ruled by O'Kelaghan. The area around the base of Slieve Guillion near Newry also became home to a large number of the McGuinness clan as they were dispossessed of hereditary lands held in the County Down.  Armagh was the seat of St. Patrick , and the Catholic Church continues to be his see. County Armagh is presently one of four counties of Northern Ireland to have a majority of the population from a Catholic background, according to the 2011 census .  The Troubles  The southern part of the County has been a stronghold of support for the IRA , earning it the nickname "Bandit Country" though this is widely regarded as an untrue media label that has resulted in the vilification and demonisation of the local community. [13] South Armagh is predominantly nationalist , with most of the population being opposed to any form of British presence, especially that of a military nature. See Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade for further information.  On 10 March 2009, the CIRA claimed responsibility for the fatal shooting of a PSNI officer in Craigavon , County Armagh—the first police fatality in Northern Ireland since 1998. The officer was fatally shot by a sniper as he and a colleague investigated "suspicious activity" at a house nearby when a window was smashed by youths causing the occupant to phone the police. The PSNI officers responded to the emergency call, giving a CIRA sniper the chance to shoot and kill officer Stephen Carroll. [14] [15]  Administration  County Armagh is no longer used as an administrative district for local Government purposes; however, it remains officially used for purposes such as a Lieutenancy area – the county retains a lord lieutenant who acts as representative of the British Monarch in the County. [16]  County Armagh ceased to serve as a local government unit in 1973. Currently the county is covered for local government purposes by four district councils , namely Armagh City and District Council , most of Craigavon Borough Council , approximately the western third of Newry and Mourne District Council and a part of Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council , centred around Peatlands Park .  With the proposed reform of local government in Northern Ireland in 2011, County Armagh would have comprised part of two new council areas, Armagh City and Bann District, and Newry City and Down; however, that reform has not proceeded to date.  Armagh ceased to serve as an electoral constituency in 1983, but remains the core of the Newry and Armagh constituency represented at Westminster and the Newry and Armagh constituency represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly . County Armagh also remains as a district for legal and property purposes; however, its baronies no longer have any administrative use.  The -XZ suffix is currently used on vehicle registration plates for vehicles registered in County Armagh.

Armagh has numerous local roads connecting settlements in the county.  Armagh once had a well-developed railway network with connections to, among others, Armagh City , Culloville , Goraghwood , Markethill , Vernersbridge , Tynan (see History of rail transport in Ireland ) but today only Newry (Bessbrook) , Portadown , Poyntzpass , Scarva , and Lurgan are served by rail.  There is a possible railway re-opening from Portadown railway station to Armagh railway station in the future. [18] Government Minister for the Department for Regional Development , Danny Kennedy MLA indicates railway restoration plans of the line from Portadown to Armagh . [19]  Ulsterbus provides the most extensive public transport system within the county, including frequent bus transfers daily from most towns to Belfast. Northern Ireland Railways / Iarnród Éireann 's Enterprise service provides connections to Dublin in little over an hour and Belfast in little over forty minutes, several times daily.  Inland waterways  County Armagh is traversed by the Ulster Canal and the Newry Canal which are not fully open to navigation.  Sport  In association football, the NIFL Premiership , which operates as the top division, has two teams in the county: Glenavon F.C. and Portadown F.C. , with Annagh United , Armagh City F.C. , Dollingstown F.C. , Loughgall F.C. and Lurgan Celtic F.C. competing in the NIFL Championship , which operates as levels two and three.

Originally opened in 1893, the station operates as a hub for Intercity services to Dublin and Tralee and commuter services to Mallow , Cobh and Midleton . In 2016, Kent Station was the fifth busiest station in the Republic Of Ireland, as well as the busiest outside of Dublin.

History [ edit ]     The station, ca. 1893.    The station opened on 2 February 1893 [2] and the current building was built in the same year. The station replaced two earlier stations that served as separate termini for the Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&WR) and Cork & Youghal Railway (C&Y). The original GS&WR station for the Glanmire line was located directly in front of the portal of the tunnel through which the railway into Cork passed, while the original C&Y terminus was above the tunnel portal. The purpose of the new station was to allow through running of trains after the 1865 takeover of the C&Y by the GS&WR. The station is the only one of the six Cork railway stations that still exists today.  The station served as a filming location for the 1979 movie The First Great Train Robbery starring Sean Connery , Donald Sutherland and Lesley-Anne Down .  On 24 February 2012, the station briefly shut due to a gas leak. [3]  On 18 December 2013, the canopy over platforms 1 and 2 collapsed in high winds; there was damage to one train and one person suffered minor injuries. [4] [5] In February 2014, €2.8 million was allocated to repair the canopy. [6]  Site improvements [ edit ]  Planning permission was granted by Cork City Council in July 2013 for a new entrance building onto Horgan's Quay and a new bi-directional road linking Railway Street/Alfred Street and Horgan's Quay. The plan also included bus shelters, a car park with 140 spaces and a set-down area accessed from Horgan's Quay for taxis and buses. [7] In February 2014, €3 million was allocated towards implementing phase one including site works and detailed planning. Work began in summer 2014. [8]  In September 2014, Irish Rail submitted a new application for two rather than one entrance building onto the quayside. [9] [10] Planning permission was granted, and Irish Rail put the entrance building project out to tender in early 2015. Construction commenced in summer 2015, and was expected to complete in approximately 12 months. [11] However, works took longer and the entrances were officially opened in November 2017. [12] [13] In parallel, a new road project (for use by buses), [12] commenced in early 2016 with its opening coinciding with the completion of the entrance building contract in November 2017. [14]  Bus Éireann now carries passengers from the new entrance to the city centre and beyond. [15]  Engine no. 36 [ edit ]     Engine No. 36    An old steam locomotive has been on permanent display at the station since 1950. "Engine No. 36" dates from 1847 and is on display on a viewing platform in the booking hall. It was restored and moved to its current position by Iarnród Éireann in 2007. [16]  Originally built by Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy of Liverpool at a cost of £1,955, the engine was obtained by the Great Southern and Western Railway to run services from Dublin to Cork. It has a 2-2-2 wheel arrangement, and remained in service until 1874. The engine was displayed at the Cork International Exhibition in 1902 , the Railway Centenary Exhibition in 1925, and the bi-centenary of the Royal Dublin Society at Ballsbridge in 1930. [16]  Services [ edit ]  The station offers direct intercity rail services to Heuston Station and stations in Kerry such as Killarney , Farranfore (for Kerry Airport ) and Tralee . Cork Suburban Rail services follow the Cobh and Mallow lines. Since July 2009, a commuter line also operates to Midleton . [17]  The station has three terminating platforms, numbered 1 to 3 (in the Cobh direction), and two through platforms, numbered 4 and 5. The only platform not directly accessible from the station concourse, platform 5, is accessed through a subway , unlike most other Irish stations, which use footbridges. Until the mid-1990s, the through platforms were numbered 5 and 6, as there had been a fourth terminating platform adjacent to platform 3; it was removed in 1984.  Since December 2005's timetable change, the through platforms tend to get quite congested as commuter trains often come in together, clogging up limited space. Since the reopening of the Cork & Youghal Railway as far as Midleton, increased use has been made of the terminating platforms 1 to 3. [ citation needed ] There is also a loop line behind platform 5, which used to be used to facilitate moving locomotives from the end of arriving trains to the other end in preparation for departure. This line used to be a double tracked freight avoiding line that enabled goods trains to bypass the passenger station. It is no longer necessary since all services to the station are operated either by railcars or by Mark 4 sets with a driving van trailer . [ citation needed ]  In 2017, the Cork to Dublin reached record usage of 3.15 million passengers, up 6.5% from 2016. [18]  Bus services [ edit ]  As of May 2017, three Bus Éireann services use Kent Station as a terminus:   205: [19]  Kent Station – Cork City Centre – University College Cork – Cork Institute of Technology  226: [20]  Kent Station – Parnell Place Bus Station – Cork Airport – Kinsale  226A: [20]  Kent Station – Parnell Place Bus Station – Cork Airport   Some other Bus Éireann services use a stop across from the station on Lower Glanmire Road, which is listed on timetables as "Lwr Glanmire Rd (Opp Kent Station)". These include:   241: [21]  Parnell Place Bus Station – Midleton – Whitegate – Trabolgan Holiday Village  260: [22]  Parnell Place Bus Station – Youghal – Ardmore   Parnell Place Bus Station is approximately a 750m walk from Kent Station.
