The series is produced by Lucasfilm Animation in collaboration with Robot Chicken creators Seth Green and Matthew Senreich , [1] [2] Although roughly two seasons of the show exist, they have never been released to the public. Since The Walt Disney Company 's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, the show has been on hiatus, to allow Lucasfilm Animation to focus on other projects. [3]  Production [ edit ]  The series was announced at Star Wars Celebration VI in summer 2012. [4] The series was intended to be set between the events of Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope . In March 2013, Lucasfilm postponed Detours , reconsidering whether releasing a comedy series prior to making the sequel trilogy "makes sense". [5] That September, Green said 39 episodes had been completed, with 62 additional scripts finished. [6]  Voice actors that were involved in the show included Dee Bradley Baker , Abraham Benrubi , Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks , Anthony Daniels as C-3PO , Felicia Day , Donald Faison , Nat Faxon , Seth Green as Obi-Wan Kenobi , Jennifer Hale , Zachary Levi , Joel McHale , Breckin Meyer , Dan Milano , Cree Summer , Catherine Taber as Princess Leia , Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian , "Weird Al" Yankovic , Grey DeLisle , and Seth MacFarlane as Palpatine .  Writers for the series included Dan Milano , Tom Root , Zeb Wells , Doug Goldstein , Breckin Meyer , Kevin Shinick , David A. Goodman , Michael Price , and Jane Espenson . Brendan Hay served as head writer. [4]  In October 2015, during a live stream, Felicia Day mentioned that the show was canceled. [7]  References [ edit ]     ^  Taylor, Chris (2014).
